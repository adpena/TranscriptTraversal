00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,612



213
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,447
A CONTRAST, THAT USUALLY MEANS 

214
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,447



215
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:23,449
THEY WILL GO ON THE OFFENSIVE.

216
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,449



217
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:25,284

00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,342



251
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,644

00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:54,580
BIT OF A TEMPERAMENT.

256
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,580

279
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,599
>> WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS

00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,408



291
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:23,642
DEFENSIVE AND REFUSED TO

00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:28,714



297
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:30,015
IF HE LOSES SUCH TEMPER RATHER I

298
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,015



299
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,384
PREDICT THAT WE WILL SEE JOE

00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,353



305
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:36,121
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.

306
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,121



307
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:38,624
LOOK AT MY POLL NUMBERS AND THAT

00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,157



311
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:40,559
DEMOCRATIC VOTERS.

00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,096



317
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:46,732
APPROPRIATE TO MAKE A JOKE.

00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,732



319
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,935
THE CONTROVERSY OVER HUGGING

00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:53,472
PERMISSION AND HE MADE A JOKE AT

326
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:53,472



327
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:54,873
AN EVENT SUBS KEPTLY, I'M

331
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,843
EXAMPLE, AND HE MADE A JOKE, AND

332
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:57,843



333
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,177
IT WAS VERY -- IT WAS VERY OUT 

334
00:07:57,843 --> 00:07:59,177



335
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,379
OF TOUCH.

336
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:00,379



337
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:01,681
IT WAS TONE DEAF GIVEN THE FACT 

338
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,681



339
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:04,750
THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS

HE DOESN'T GAFFE THAT WAY 

344
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,686



345
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:09,221
SFWLEERT SPEAKING OF THE SERIOUS

LAST NIGHT DID WE SEE THE 

350
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,624



351
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:15,093
MOMENTS WHERE THE CANDIDATES 

352
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:15,093



353
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,295
ALMOST LIKE TRIED TO OUTDEMOCRAT

354
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:16,295



355
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:17,730
EACH OTHER GO, AS FAR AS THEY 

356
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,730



357
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,465
COULD TO THE LEFT, BUT IF THEY

00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:21,200
DO THAT TONIGHT DO THEY RISK 

360
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,200



361
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,600
THEN ALIENATING THE GENERAL

364
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,868



365
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:24,637

369
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,107
WOULD EVEN ARGUE MAYOR PETE IN

I THINK BERNIE SANDERS, HOWEVER,

380
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,086



381
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,020

00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,325



391
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,659

393
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,226
CANDIDATE BUT, REMEMBER, I'M THE

394
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:48,226



395
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,561
ORIGINAL GUY.

396
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:49,561

2016, AND NOW LOOK AT HOW I HAVE

402
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:55,501



403
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,101
SHAPED AND TRANSFORMED THE 

404
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,101



405
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:57,470
DEMOCRATIC THAT'S RIGHT.

406

00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,038

00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,675

BACKGROUND.

636
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,355
CAMPAIGN.

637
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,355



638
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,590
FOR NOW THOUGH THINGS ARE QUITE,

639
00:15:57,355 --> 00:15:58,590

LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT 

643
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,627



644
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:02,193
ATMOSPHERE TONIGHT I THINK FOR 

645
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,193



646
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,762
TWO REASONS.

647
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:03,762



648
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:04,797

00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,364



652
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,999
LAST NIGHT, PERFORMED LAST 

653

654
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,601
NIGHT, HAVE NOW SEEN HOW THIS 

655
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:09,601



656
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:11,370
PROCESS GOES, AND THE FOLKS WHO 

657
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,370

00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:12,671

00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,671



660
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,471
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE 

661
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:13,471



662
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:15,206
MODERATORS ARE TREATING THE 

663
00:16:13,471 --> 00:16:15,206



664
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:17,142
QUESTIONS AND HOW THE CANDIDATES

665
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:17,142



666
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,843
ARE LIKELY TO TREAT EACH OTHER 

667
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,843



668
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:20,645
AND TONIGHT YOU HAVE MORE OF THE

00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:20,645

00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:21,179
EXPERIENCED DEBATERS ON THE 

671
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:21,179



672
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,147
STAGE.

673
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:22,147



674
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,481
JOE BIDEN AND BERNIE SANDERS

00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,616
HAVE BOTH DONE THE 

677
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:24,616



678
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,318
MULTI-CANDIDATE PRESIDENTIAL

00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,318



680
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:27,686
FORMULA BEFORE, AND EVEN THOUGH 

681
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,686



682
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:29,288
THE OTHER CANDIDATES WHO HAVE 

683
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,288



684
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:30,855
NOT KAMALA HARRIS, FOR EXAMPLE, 

685
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,855



686
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,391
MICHAEL BENNETT, SOME OF THESE 

687
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:32,391



688
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:33,958
SENATORS ARE A LITTLE MORE 

689
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,958



690
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:36,195
PRACTICED IN THIS TYPE OF 

691
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,195



692
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:38,630
DEBATING, SO I DO THINK IT'S A 

693
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,630



694
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:43,468
LITTLE BIT LESS OF THAT NEAR 

695
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:43,468



696
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:45,471
VOWS ENERGY THAN LAST NIGHT WHEN

697
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:45,471



698
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:47,305
SO MANY PEOPLE WERE LOOKING FOR 

699
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,305



700
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,440
THE MOMENT TO BREAK OUT. 

701
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:48,440



702
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,008
>> I WAS FOLLOWING YOU LAST 

703
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,008



704
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:51,276
NIGHT ON TWITTER AND SEEING YOU 

705
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,276

707
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,444



708
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:55,114
MOMENT IN THIS ROOM WITH BETO.

709
00:16:53,444 --> 00:16:55,114



710
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:56,481
WHAT DID YOU LEARN AND WHAT WAS 

711
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,481



712
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,782
THE SCOOP THAT YOU GOT LAST 

713
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:56,782



714
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:57,849
NIGHT?

715
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:57,849



716
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,052
>> I THINK TWO THINGS.

717
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:00,052



718
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:01,820
NUMBER ONE, JULIAN CASTRO'S BIG 

719
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,820



720
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,187
MOMENT WITH BETO O'ROUKE WAS NO 

721
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,187



722
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:03,222
ACCIDENT.

723
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,222



724
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,657
THAT WAS VERY MUCH A PLANNED 

725
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,657



726
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:07,493
MOMENT OF TRYING TO CONTRAST 

727
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,493



728
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:11,430
WITH ANOTHER TEXAN ON A VERY 

729
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:11,430



730
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:12,764
SPECIFIC ISSUE, TO PUT O'ROURKE 

731
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,764



732
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,399
ON HIS BACK HEEL.

733
00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:14,399



734
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:16,535
WHAT YOU SAW IN THAT EXCHANGE 

735
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:16,535



736
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:16,935
WAS A DIFFERENCE IN STYLE AND 

737
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:16,935



738
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,736
PREPARATION.

739
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,736



740
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:20,772
O'ROURKE SAID ALL ALONG HE'S NOT

741
00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:20,772



742
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:22,207
MUCH OF A DEBATE-FOCUSED GUY.

743
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:22,207



744
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,475
HE'S A STORYTELLER AND WANTS TO 

745
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,475



746
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,210
TELL THE STORY OF THE PEOPLE 

747
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,210



748
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:26,578
HE'S MET AROUND THE COUNTRY AND 

749
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,578



750
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:28,012

VERY SPECIFIC POINT ABOUT POLICY

753
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:30,248



754
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:30,982
AND WANTED TO MAKE IT AT BETO 

755
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:30,982



756
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,750
O'ROUKE'S EXPENSE.

757
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:32,750



758
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,785
TEXAS IS A BIG STATE, BUT 

759
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,785



760
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:36,721
THERE'S PROBABLY NOT ROOM ENOUGH

761
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:36,721



762
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,956

766
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,392
STATE.

767
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,392



768
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,060
THEY COMPETE FOR DONORS AND

00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,060



770
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:43,729
VOTERS AND ATTENTION.

771
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,729



772
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,762
AND THEY WILL COMPETE AGAIN 

773
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,762

>> INTERESTING. 

783
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,909



784
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:59,111
>> I ALSO SAW THAT FORMER 

785
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,111

00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:07,519



794
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:10,589
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE STRATEGY?

795
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,589



796
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:11,657
HOW DO YOU THINK THE STRATEGY 

797
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,657



798
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,758
WILL BE DIFFERENT TONIGHT?

799
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,758



800
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,060

801
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,060



802
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:16,694
THE TWO FRONT-RUNNERS IN THE

STRATEGIES.

807
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:18,129



808
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:19,064
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT 

809
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:19,064

814
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,467
LESS THAN DONALD TRUMP.

815
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,467



816
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,269
EVERYONE ELSE ON THAT STAGE MAY 

817
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,269

00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,305
OBJECTIVES.

00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,622



882
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:18,289
OF THE WAYS THAT BERNIE SANDERS 

883
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:18,289



884
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,259

THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES PROVE 

946
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:06,611



947
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,612
THAT THEY ARE STILL TOUGH ON 

948
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,612



949
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:09,614

951
00:24:07,745 --> 00:24:10,281

953
00:24:09,747 --> 00:24:13,151
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

954
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:13,151



955
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:15,386
>> THEY HAVE BEEN PRETTY SILENT

957
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:16,921
ON FOREIGN POLICY IN GENERAL.

958
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:16,921



959
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:18,557
THEY HAVEN'T GONE TO PUT OUT A 

960
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:18,557



961
00:24:17,054 --> 00:24:20,292
LOT OF FOREIGN POLICY, AND I 

962
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,292



963
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,493
THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY CANNOT 

964
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,493



965
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,227
DIFFERENTIATE THEMSELVES 

966
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,227



967
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,962
STRONGLY FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP.

968
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,962



969
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,830
I MEAN, I THINK THEY WISH THEY 

970
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:25,830



971
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,432
COULD, BUT CERTAINLY WHEN IT 

972
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,432



973
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:28,099
COMES TO CHINA A LOT OF THEM 

974
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,099



975
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:30,468
FEEL THAT THE UNITED STATES 

976
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,468



977
00:24:28,232 --> 00:24:31,836
SHOULD BE TOUGH ON CHINA.

978
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,836



979
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,504
I THINK THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY

980
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:33,504



981
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,973
GO ABOUT IT A DIFFERENT WAY, BUT

982
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:34,973



983
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,374
THEY ARE NOT GIVING US DETAILS 

984
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,374



985
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:38,009
ON HOW -- ON WHAT THEIR PLANS 

986
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,009



987
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:40,045
WOULD BE, HOW THEY WOULD LIKE TO

988
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,045



989
00:24:38,142 --> 00:24:40,945
GO WHEN IT COMES TO CHINA 

990
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:40,945



991
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,613
SPECIFICALLY.

992
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:42,613



993
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,115
HOW THEY WOULD GO IN A TOUGHER 

994
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:44,115



995
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,049
MANNER, AND I THINK THAT GOES 

996
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,049



997
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:46,751
ACROSS THE BOARD WHETHER IT'S 

998
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:46,751

00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:48,453
IRAN AND RUSSIA IN GENERAL. 

1000
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,453



1001
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,787
>> SO WE'RE MISSING THE TACTICS.

1002
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:49,787



1003
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:50,655
>> YOU'RE NODDING YOUR HEAD. 

1004
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:50,655



1005
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,090
>> THAT'S TRUE.

1006
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,090



1007
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:54,659
>> THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT REALLY

00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,659



1009
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:58,430
FOCUSED ON FOREIGN POLICY.

1010
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,430



1011
00:24:54,793 --> 00:25:01,232
>> THIS EARLY IN THE PRIMACY

00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,232



1013
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:02,199
VOTERS AREN'T FOCUSING IN.

1014
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:02,199



1015
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,902

PUSH NOTIFICATION THAT SAYS WE 

1028
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,110



1029
00:25:10,908 --> 00:25:13,611
WERE GOING TO BOMB THEM AND 

1030
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,611



1031
00:25:12,243 --> 00:25:14,245
CHANGED OUR MINDS AT THE LAST 

1032
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:14,245



1033
00:25:13,744 --> 00:25:15,913
MINUTE THAT CAN BE REAL 

1034
00:25:14,245 --> 00:25:15,913



1035
00:25:14,378 --> 00:25:17,015
CONCERNING AND I DO WANT TO HEAR

1036
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:17,015



1037
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:19,184
DEMOCRATS BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT

1038
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,184



1039
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,918
THEY ARE GOING TO DO THAT IS 

1040
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:19,918



1041
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,753
DIFFERENT FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP 

1042
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,753



1043
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:23,354
AND NOT JUST PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

1044
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,354



1045
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:24,455
RHETORIC BUT HIS ACTUAL 

1046
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:24,455



1047
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,923
ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY BECAUSE 

1048
00:25:24,455 --> 00:25:25,923



1049
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,358
THOSE TWO THINGS ARE DIFFERENT. 

1050
00:25:25,923 --> 00:25:27,358



1051
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:28,025
>> WE'VE HEARD SOME SPECIFICS 

1052
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:28,025



1053
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,427
THOUGH.

1054
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:29,427



1055
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,762
JOE BIDEN SAID THAT CHINA WAS 

1056
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,762



1057
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,896
NOT DIRECT COMPETITION AND THEN 

1058
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:31,896



1059
00:25:30,895 --> 00:25:33,331
WE SAW BERNIE SANDERS SAY, WAIT 

1060
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:33,331



1061
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:35,367
A MINUTE, UNTRUE.

1062
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,367



1063
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:35,767
IT'S ABSOLUTELY AN ECONOMIC 

1064
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:35,767



1065
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,668
COMPETITION.

1066
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:36,668



1067
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,136
WHICH OF THOSE MESSAGES DO YOU 

1068
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,136



1069
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,370
THINK IS GOING TO WIN OUT AND 

1070
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,370



1071
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:40,705
PLAY BEST WITH VOTERS TONIGHT?

1072
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,705



1073
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:42,507
>> I THINK FOR THE DEMOCRATS IF 

1074
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,507



1075
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:45,110
THEY FOCUS ON INTELLECTUAL 

1076
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:45,110



1077
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,310
PROPERTY, THAT'S A BIG THING 

1078
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,310



1079
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,978
THAT I THINK YOU CAN DISTINGUISH

1080
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,978



1081
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:48,346
YOURSELF FROM THE PRESIDENT.

1082
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:48,346



1083
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:49,781
YOU ALSO LOOK AT CHINA AND LOOK 

1084
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:49,781



1085
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:51,182
AT WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND 

1086
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,182



1087
00:25:49,914 --> 00:25:53,485
ESSENTIALLY IN OUR OWN BACKYARD 

1088
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,485



1089
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:54,753
IN SOUTH AMERICA, GIVING OUT 

1090
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:54,753



1091
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:57,355
ZERO FREE INTEREST LOANS, LIKE 

1092
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,355



1093
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:58,055
WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN SOUTH 

1094
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:58,055



1095
00:25:57,488 --> 00:25:59,657
AFRICA.

1096
00:25:58,055 --> 00:25:59,657



1097
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:01,625
THERE ARE VERY NUANCED WAYS TO 

1098
00:25:59,657 --> 00:26:01,625



1099
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,294
SORT OF MAKE A CLEAR DISTINCTION

1100
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,294



1101
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,964
FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN FROM THE 

1102
00:26:03,294 --> 00:26:05,964



1103
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:07,398
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND AS IT 

1104
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,398



1105
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:10,035
RELATES TO IRAN STABILITY.

1106
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:10,035



1107
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:11,536
DON'T TRUMP FOR ME, VOTE FOR ME 

1108
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,536



1109
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,936
BECAUSE I THINK I'LL BRING 

1110
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:11,936



1111
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:12,771
STABILITY. 

1112
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:12,771



1113
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,205
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY COULD SAY 

1114
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,205



1115
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,572
BUT THEY ARE NOT. 

1116
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:14,572



1117
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,907
>> RIGHT. 

1118
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:15,907



1119
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,475
>> ON CHINA, THIS WOULD BE AN 

1120
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,475



1121
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,477
EASY ONE TO SAY THAT CHINA, 

1122
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,477



1123
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:21,646
BECAUSE OF THE TARIFFS THAT 

1124
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,646



1125
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,114
WE'RE IMPOSING, THAT ARE HURTING

1126
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,114



1127
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,215
AMERICAN COMPANIES AND AMERICAN 

1128
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,215



1129
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:27,185
CONSUMERS, THE CHINESE ARE GOING

1130
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:27,185



1131
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,618
AROUND AND DOING BUSINESS WITH 

1132
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:27,618



1133
00:26:27,318 --> 00:26:30,454
EVERYONE ELSE.

1134
00:26:27,618 --> 00:26:30,454



1135
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,555
WE SHOULD HAVE ALLIES AROUND THE

1136
00:26:30,454 --> 00:26:31,555



1137
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:33,024
WORLD SAYING LET'S WORK TOGETHER

1138
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:33,024



1139
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:34,158
TO CONFRONT CHINA SO THE 

1140
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,158



1141
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:35,260
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES COULD SAY 

1142
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:35,260



1143
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:37,328
THAT, BUT THEY ARE NOT SAYING, 

1144
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,328



1145
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,629
THAT AND I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

1146
00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:37,629



1147
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:38,830
WHY. 

1148
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:38,830



1149
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,264
>> IT'S A LITTLE SURPRISING TO 

1150
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,264



1151
00:26:38,963 --> 00:26:41,099
SEE HOW LIGHT EVERYONE WAS ON 

1152
00:26:40,264 --> 00:26:41,099



1153
00:26:40,397 --> 00:26:41,466
FOREIGN POLICY. 

1154
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:41,466



1155
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:42,434
>> RIGHT. 

1156
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,434



1157
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,102
>> BUT DO YOU THINK WHEN WE 

1158
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,102



1159
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:46,470
BRING IT BACK HOME TO DOMESTIC 

1160
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,470



1161
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:47,572
ISSUES THAT WILL CHANGE THINGS?

1162
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,572



1163
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,240
FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW ROBERT 

1164
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,240



1165
00:26:47,705 --> 00:26:50,141
MUELLER JUST DECIDED HE WAS IN 

1166
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,141



1167
00:26:49,373 --> 00:26:51,442
FACT GOING TO TESTIFY.

1168
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,442



1169
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,444
DO YOU THINK THAT WILL CHANGE 

1170
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:52,444



1171
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:54,245
THE CONVERSATION AROUND THE 

1172
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,245



1173
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:55,413
MUELLER REPORT OR EVEN RUSSIA'S 

1174
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,413



1175
00:26:54,378 --> 00:26:56,748
ROLE IN THE 2016 ELECTION?

1176
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,748



1177
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,183
>> AND IT SHOULD CHANGE THE 

1178
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,183



1179
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,550
CONVERSATION, I'M SURPRISED THAT

1180
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,550



1181
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,952
RUSSIA DIDN'T COME UP.

1182
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,952



1183
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:02,120
BILL de BLASIO WAS THE ONLY ONE 

1184
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,120



1185
00:27:01,085 --> 00:27:05,623
WHO MENTIONED RUSSIA, AND WE 

1186
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,623



1187
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:05,957
IMMEDIATE TO BE TALKING ABOUT 

1188
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:05,957



1189
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:11,796
RUSSIA.

1190
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:11,796



1191
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:13,264
THEY ARE STILL BOT ARMIES TRYING

1192
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,264



1193
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,665
TO INFILTRATE OUR ELECTIONS AND 

1194
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:14,665



1195
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,067
STILL DOING THE SAME THINGS THEY

1196
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:16,067



1197
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,203
ARE DOING IN 2016.

1198
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,203



1199
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,070
NEED TO BE VERY VIGILANT AND 

1200
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,070



1201
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,272
PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T BELIEVE 

1202
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,272



1203
00:27:19,203 --> 00:27:22,339
THEY REALLY DID IT SO HE HASN'T 

1204
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,339



1205
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:24,375
PUT FORWARD ANY POLICY.

1206
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:24,375



1207
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:25,509
THAT'S AN OPENING THAT WOULD TIE

1208
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,509



1209
00:27:24,508 --> 00:27:26,578
TOGETHER DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN 

1210
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:26,578



1211
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:28,279
POLICY BY SAYING THIS IS WHAT 

1212
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,279



1213
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,848
I'M GOING TO DO TO ENSURE THAT 

1214
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,848



1215
00:27:28,412 --> 00:27:30,215
OUR ELECTION SYSTEMS ARE 

1216
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:30,215



1217
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,983
PROTECTED.

1218
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,983



1219
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,551
>> I THINK DEMOCRATS NEED TO BE 

1220
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,551



1221
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:35,820
CAREFUL WITH THE IMPEACHMENT 

1222
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,820



1223
00:27:33,684 --> 00:27:38,556
NOTION AND I'M TELL YOU WHY, OF 

1224
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,556



1225
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:41,659
THE 61 SEATS THAT THEY WON IN 

1226
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:41,659



1227

00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:45,796
TRUMP WON.

1234
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:45,796

1239
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,734
SOME OF THOSE MEMBERS AND WHAT 

1240
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,734

1245
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,505
TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHING TRUMP.

1246
00:27:53,137 --> 00:27:54,505



1247
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,974
THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO HEAR 

1248
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:55,974



1249
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:57,342
THAT WHICH IS WHY I THINK NANCY 

1250
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,342



1251
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,509
PELOSI HAS BEEN VERY, VERY 

1252
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,509



1253
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:00,311
CAREFUL BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT

1254
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:00,311



1255
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:01,946
TO RISK LOSING HER MAJORITY SO I

1256
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:01,946



1257
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:03,247
THINK IT'S GREAT TO SAY THAT FOR

1258
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,247



1259
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,749
THE BASE OF THE PARTY, BUT THEY 

1260
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:04,749



1261
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,351
NEED TO BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL 

1262
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,351

00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:10,154
THAT THEY WON IN 2018 THAT I 

1266
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,154



1267
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:12,523
WOULD ARGUE THAT THEY NEED IN 

1268
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:12,523



1269
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,857
2020 IF THEY PLAN TO BEAT DONALD

1270
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:12,857



1271
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:13,591
TRUMP. 

1272
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,591



1273
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,694
>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S A PUSH 

1274
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:16,694



1275
00:28:13,724 --> 00:28:18,129

1278
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,131

00:28:18,262 --> 00:28:20,532
THE ONES IN CONGRESS IS FOR 

1280
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:20,532



1281
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:21,499
IMPEACHMENT.

1282
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,499



1283
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,633
THERE ARE 80 OR SO DEMOCRATS ON 

1284
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,633



1285
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:25,103
THE RECORD SAYING THEY ARE 

1286
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:25,103



1287
00:28:22,766 --> 00:28:25,770
CALLING FOR IMPEACHMENT.

1288
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:25,770



1289
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,038
THE NUMBER IS GOING UP, BUT 

1290
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,038



1291
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,371
THAT'S LESS THAN HALF THE 

1292
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:27,371



1293
00:28:27,171 --> 00:28:29,540
CAUCUS.

1294
00:28:27,371 --> 00:28:29,540



1295
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:30,775
THAT'S NOT THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE

1296
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,775



1297
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,043
CONVERSATION, THE LOUDEST VOICES

1298
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,043



1299
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:33,011
ARE TALKING ABOUT IT, BUT I 

1300
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,011



1301
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,444
DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S THE 

1302
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:33,444



1303
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,679
ULTIMATE GOAL.

1304
00:28:33,444 --> 00:28:34,679



1305
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:36,113

1307
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:37,415
TERM IS THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO

1308
00:28:36,113 --> 00:28:37,415

00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,150



1315
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:40,651
NOW THAT WE HAVE ROBERT MUELLER 

1316

THAT'S ON THE PAGES THAT

00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:47,792



1325
00:28:45,222 --> 00:28:49,026
AMERICANS HAVE NOT READ AND

00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,842
SAME THING.

BUT AS A STRATEGIST I'M TELLING 

1490
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,046



1491
00:30:46,343 --> 00:30:49,747
YOU IF DEMOCRATS WANT TO GO IN

1499
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,252
COMMITTEE THAT'S GOING TO FOCUS

00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,621
ON THOSE MEMBERS AND THEY ARE

MAJORITY.

1513
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:08,932
DAY. 

1514
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:08,932



1515
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:10,034
>> MY VIEW IS MORE FROM THE 

1516
00:31:08,932 --> 00:31:10,034



1517
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:11,402
FOREIGN POLICY ANGLE.

1518
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,402



1519
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:12,870
YOU STARTED ASKING ROBERT 

1520
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:12,870



1521
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,371
MUELLER, HOW DOES THIS AFFECT 

1522
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,371



1523
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,172
OUR CONVERSATION.

1524
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,172



1525
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:18,375
I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE,

1526
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:18,375



1527
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:20,111
I MEAN, TO NO ONE'S SURPRISE I'M

1528
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,111



1529
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,945
GOING TO SAY I THINK FOREIGN 

1530
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,945



1531
00:31:20,244 --> 00:31:23,681
POLICY IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT 

1532
00:31:21,945 --> 00:31:23,681



1533
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,683
BUT FOR THE VOTER IT'S REALLY 

1534
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,683



1535
00:31:23,814 --> 00:31:27,251
ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND 

1536
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:27,251



1537
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:29,120
HEALTHCARE, AND THAT BEING SAID,

1538
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:29,120



1539
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,621
FOREIGN POLICY CERTAINLY NOW IS 

1540
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,621



1541
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:32,289
REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE IT 

1542
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:32,289



1543
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:34,392
ENTERED OUR ELECTIONS IN 2016 

1544
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:34,392



1545
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,692
AND HAD A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE 

1546
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:34,692



1547
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:35,626
VOTER.

1548
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:35,626



1549
00:31:34,825 --> 00:31:36,727
VOTERS SHOULD CARE.

1550
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:36,727



1551
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,728
THEY MAY NOT KNOW THEY SHOULD 

1552
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:37,728



1553
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:39,630
CARE AT THE MOMENT AND THAT'S 

1554
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,630



1555
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,997
WHY EDUCATING THEN IS SO 

1556
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:39,997



1557
00:31:39,763 --> 00:31:41,532
CRITICAL.

1558
00:31:39,997 --> 00:31:41,532



1559
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,399
ON IMPEACHMENT, THIS IS A 

1560
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:42,399



1561
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:43,835
SEPARATE STORY.

1562
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,835



1563
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:47,705
MY VIEW IS THAT IT'S A 

1564
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:47,705



1565
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:48,072
DISTRACTION AND THAT'S MY OWN 

1566
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:48,072



1567
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,275
OPINION. 

1568
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,275



1569
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:52,543
>> WHAT I'M SAYING IS I WANT 

1570
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:52,543



1571
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:54,612
THERE TO BE SERIOUS AND FORMAL 

1572
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,612



1573
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:56,748
HEARINGS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN. 

1574
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,748



1575
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:57,115
>> BUT PEOPLE SHOULD BE TALKING 

1576
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,115



1577
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,116
ABOUT IT. 

1578
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,116



1579
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,816
>> ARE YOU KILLING TWO BIRDS 

1580
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:58,816



1581
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,418
WITH ONE STONE?

1582
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,418



1583
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:01,552
IS THAT HOW YOU EDUCATE THEM 

1584
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,552



1585
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,019
THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF THE 

1586
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:02,019



1587
00:32:01,685 --> 00:32:06,090
MUELLER REPORT?

1588
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:06,090



1589
00:32:02,152 --> 00:32:07,592
>> YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO 

1590
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,592



1591
00:32:06,223 --> 00:32:09,259
LOUDER -- THE LOUDSPEAKER THAT 

1592
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,259

1595
00:32:09,393 --> 00:32:12,296
MUCH LARGER THAN ANY HEARING, 

1596
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:12,296



1597
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,631
THAN ANY NEWSPAPER ARTICLE.

1598
00:32:12,296 --> 00:32:13,631



1599
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,333
THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT 

1600
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,333



1601
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:17,268

00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,772
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT.

1608
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,772



1609
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:23,141
THIS IS WHAT RUSSIA IS DOING.

1610
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:23,141



1611
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,575
CHINA COULD BE DOING THIS, AND 

1612
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,575



1613
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,942
THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO DO 

1614
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:24,942

00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,817

GENUINELY AND NOT JUST DOING IT 

1828
00:37:55,572 --> 00:37:58,308



1829
00:37:55,705 --> 00:37:59,676
FOR THE POLITICAL ASPECT OF IT. 

1830
00:37:58,308 --> 00:37:59,676



1831
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,245
>> WE'VE HEARD THAT VICE 

1832
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:01,245



1833
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,380
PRESIDENT BIDEN DOESN'T VIEW 

1834
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:02,380



1835
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:06,216
CHINA AS AN ECONOMIC THREAT AND 

1836
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,216



1837
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:07,851
WHEN YOU GO TO A PLACE LIKE 

1838
00:38:06,216 --> 00:38:07,851



1839
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,953
PITTSBURGH, THE U.S. STEEL PLANT

1840
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:09,953



1841
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:12,356
HAS A 1.5 BILLION INVESTMENT AND

1842
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:12,356



1843
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:14,358
HOW IS BIDEN GOING TO GO TO THAT

1844
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,358



1845
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,193
PART OF AMERICA AND SAY I'M THE 

1846
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,193



1847
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:18,328
BETTER CANDIDATE FOR THE WORKING

1848
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,328



1849
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,862
CLASS AND DISTINGUISH HIMSELF 

1850
00:38:18,328 --> 00:38:18,862



1851
00:38:18,461 --> 00:38:20,664
FROM THE PRESIDENT. 

1852
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:20,664



1853
00:38:18,995 --> 00:38:21,999
>> SOUNDS LIKE HE'S NOT REALLY 

1854
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:21,999



1855
00:38:20,797 --> 00:38:22,599
RESONATING BOTH WITH POLICY AND 

1856
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:22,599



1857
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:24,668
WITH MESSAGING.

1858
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,668



1859
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:26,203
I MEAN, ONE OF THE REASONS SOME 

1860
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:26,203



1861
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:27,505
PEOPLE ARE MORE EXCITED ABOUT 

1862
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,505



1863
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:29,573
HIM, ARE MORE EXCITED ABOUT HIM 

1864
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:29,573



1865
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:31,142
IS BECAUSE OF THE LONG TRACK 

1866
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,142



1867
00:38:29,706 --> 00:38:32,309
RECORD HE HAS AND THE KIND OF 

1868
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,309



1869
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:34,211
EXPERIENCE THAT HE HAS.

1870
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,211



1871
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,846
SOMEONE WHO IS ALSO A 

1872
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:35,846



1873
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:37,047
FRONT-RUNNER ON THE STABLE WHO 

1874
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,047



1875
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:38,615
HAS THE LEAST GOVERNMENT 

1876
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:38,615



1877
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,716
EXPERIENCE IS PUT BUTTIGIEG.

1878
00:38:38,615 --> 00:38:39,716



1879
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,552
THINKING ABOUT THOSE TWO, 

1880
00:38:39,716 --> 00:38:41,552



1881
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,220
THERE'S ABOUT A 40-YEAR AGE GAP 

1882
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,220



1883
00:38:41,685 --> 00:38:45,623
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM AND THAT

1884
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,623



1885
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,189
SAYS A LOT ABOUT EXPERIENCE AND 

1886
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:46,189



1887
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:48,559
PERSPECTIVE.

1888
00:38:46,189 --> 00:38:48,559



1889
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:48,859
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCES 

1890
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:48,859



1891
00:38:48,692 --> 00:38:50,161
THERE.

1892
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,161



1893
00:38:48,992 --> 00:38:50,727
WHAT'S RESONATING MORE WITH YOU 

1894
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:50,727



1895
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,329
GUYS?

1896
00:38:50,727 --> 00:38:52,329



1897
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:53,863
A LOT OF YOU MORE WERE EXCITED 

1898
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,863



1899
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:55,900
ABOUT BUTTIGIEG.

1900
00:38:53,863 --> 00:38:55,900



1901
00:38:53,997 --> 00:38:56,534
WHY IS THAT SOMETHING THAT GETS 

1902
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,534



1903
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:59,203
YOU GOING?

1904
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:59,203



1905
00:38:56,667 --> 00:39:00,871
>> WELL, I MEAN, YEAH.

1906
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:00,871



1907
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:02,206
NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE'S YOUNG BUT 

1908
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,206



1909
00:39:01,004 --> 00:39:05,375
BECAUSE HE'S BRING IDEAS.

1910
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:05,375



1911
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:07,478
THE REASON WHY I THINK BIDEN HAS

1912
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:07,478



1913
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:10,347
A BIG TEST, HE'S NOT BRING NEW 

1914
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,347



1915
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:11,882
AND EXCITING INNOVATIVE IDEAS.

1916
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:11,882



1917
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,383
YES, HE'S YOUNG BUT HE'S GOING 

1918
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,383



1919
00:39:12,015 --> 00:39:14,818
TO BRING NEW IDEAS AND THAT'S 

1920
00:39:13,383 --> 00:39:14,818



1921
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,720
WHAT WE WANT TO SEE.

1922
00:39:14,818 --> 00:39:16,720



1923
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:18,989
WE WANT TO SEE TAX REFORM AND 

1924
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,989



1925
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:20,724
REFORM OF THE PRISON SYSTEM AND 

1926
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:20,724



1927
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:22,125
WITH BIDEN THE CONVERSATION HAS 

1928
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:22,125



1929
00:39:20,857 --> 00:39:23,327
NEVER BEEN ABOUT REFORM, KEEPING

1930
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:23,327



1931
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,361
THINGS HOW THEY ARE AND JUST 

1932
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:24,361



1933
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,029
TWEAKING THEM A LITTLE BIT AND 

1934
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,029



1935
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,763
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE A LITTLE 

1936
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:26,763



1937
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,865
BIT OF TWEAK.

1938
00:39:26,763 --> 00:39:27,865



1939
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,533
THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR FUTURE 

1940
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,533



1941
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:30,967
SO FOR US IT'S REALLY KEY TO 

1942
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,967



1943
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:33,637
FIND CANDIDATES WHO ARE ACTUALLY

GOING TO TALK ABOUT INNOVATION 

1946
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,839



1947
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:38,041
AND HOW THEY WILL HAVE AN EFFECT

1948
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,041



1949
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:39,143
IN THREE YEARS AND TWO YEARS 

1950
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,143



1951
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:43,080
WHEN THEY ARE ALREADY EFFECTED 

1952
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:43,080



1953
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:44,815

1955
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:46,317
>> AND THERE'S THE PERSPECTIVE 

1956
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,317



1957
00:39:44,948 --> 00:39:47,651
GAP BETWEEN BUTTIGIEG AND BIDEN 

1958
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,651

DIFFERENTLY.

1966
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:53,524



1967
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:55,059

2226
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,278
REALLY CAPTURES HIS 

2227
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,278



2228
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:52,282
INCREMENTALIST APPROACH AND THAT

2229
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:52,282



2230
00:45:48,411 --> 00:45:54,618
HERE I THINK IS WHAT YOU'RE 

2231
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,618



2232
00:45:52,415 --> 00:45:56,720
SEEING THESE KIDS THAT WERE 

2233
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,720



2234
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:59,223
AGAINST THIS SORT OF SLOW BOIL 

2235
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,223



2236
00:45:56,853 --> 00:46:01,892
AND ARE IN FAVOR OF MORE 

2237
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,892



2238
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:03,259
DRAMATIC POLICIES THAT CAN 

2239
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,259



2240
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:04,994
EFFECT CHANGE TOMORROW. 

2241
00:46:03,259 --> 00:46:04,994



2242
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:06,362
>> YOU'RE CHUCKLING, WHY?

2243
00:46:04,994 --> 00:46:06,362



2244
00:46:05,128 --> 00:46:10,100
>> BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALISTIC.

2245
00:46:06,362 --> 00:46:10,100



2246
00:46:06,496 --> 00:46:11,367
I RESPECT THE KIDS AND I GET IT,

2247
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,367



2248
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:11,968
BUT I'VE WORKED IN POLITICS FOR 

2249
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:11,968



2250
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:14,204
A WHILE NOW.

2251
00:46:11,968 --> 00:46:14,204



2252
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,471
I'VE BEEN IN D.C. FOR A WHILE 

2253
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:14,471



2254
00:46:14,337 --> 00:46:17,173
NOW.

2255
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,173



2256
00:46:14,604 --> 00:46:18,375
THAT'S JUST NOT HOW THINGS WORK,

2257
00:46:17,173 --> 00:46:18,375



2258
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:21,044
AND I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES 

2259
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:21,044



2260
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:23,379
FOR SOMEONE LIKE AN AOC SHE'S 

2261
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:23,379



2262
00:46:21,177 --> 00:46:24,213
FOUND OUT FAST THAT THE GREEN 

2263
00:46:23,379 --> 00:46:24,213



2264
00:46:23,513 --> 00:46:25,415
NEW DEAL, JUST HOW D.C. WORKS.

2265
00:46:24,213 --> 00:46:25,415



2266
00:46:24,347 --> 00:46:26,683
HAVE YOU TO WORK IN REALITY AND 

2267
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:26,683



2268
00:46:25,548 --> 00:46:28,218
YOU HAVE TO GET OTHER MEMBERS 

2269
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,218



2270
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:29,819
AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN

2271
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:29,819



2272
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:33,156
PARTY TO WORK WITH YOU TO PASS 

2273
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:33,156



2274
00:46:29,952 --> 00:46:33,556
SOME OF THESE PIECES OF 

2275
00:46:33,156 --> 00:46:33,556



2276
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:35,959
LEGISLATION.

2277
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:35,959



2278
00:46:33,689 --> 00:46:37,360
IT'S NOT ABOUT INCREMENTALISM. 

2279
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,360



2280
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,795
>> JOHN DELANEY HAD A GREAT 

2281
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,795



2282
00:46:37,493 --> 00:46:39,763
CONVERSATION TODAY AND WENT BACK

2283
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:39,763



2284
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:41,865
AND FORTH ON THIS TOPIC AND SOME

2285
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:41,865

COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD HAVE

00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,804



2292
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:50,407
TRANSITIONED VERY EASILY

POLITICAL SYSTEM OR SETUP THAT 

2305
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:01,818



2306
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:03,587
WE DO, PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU 

2307
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,587



2308
00:47:01,951 --> 00:47:05,021
THINK ABOUT THE PARTISANSHIP 

2309
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,021



2310
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,823
THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS. 

2311
00:47:05,021 --> 00:47:06,823



2312
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,391

2313
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:07,391



2314
00:47:06,956 --> 00:47:10,027
REALISTIC OPTION?

2315
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:10,027



2316
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:11,461
>> I REALLY CANNOT WRAP MY HEAD 

2317
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:11,461



2318
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,163
AROUND HOW IT'S FUNDED AND WHEN 

2319
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:13,163



2320
00:47:11,594 --> 00:47:14,798
YOU ASK, WHEN CANDIDATES HAVE 

2321
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,798



2322
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:16,300
BEEN ASKED, KAMALA HARRIS HAVE 

2323
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:16,300



2324
00:47:14,931 --> 00:47:18,869
BEEN ASKED, THEY FUMBLE OVER 

2325
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,869



2326
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:20,704
THEIR WORDS, WELL, WE'LL 

2327
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:20,704



2328
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:22,639
INCREASE TAXES AND INCREASE ON

00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:23,473

2332
00:47:22,772 --> 00:47:25,475
ESTATE TAXES.

00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:25,475



2334
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:28,211
NONE OF THAT ACTUALLY MAKES 

2335
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:28,211



2336
00:47:25,608 --> 00:47:30,914
SENSE AND NONE OF IT TO ME SEEMS

2337
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:30,914



2338
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,848
VERY FEASIBLE FOR THE REASONS 

2339
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:31,848



2340
00:47:31,047 --> 00:47:33,150
MENTIONED BECAUSE WASHINGTON 

2341
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:33,150



2342
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,318
DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT AND IT 

2343
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,318



2344
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:38,755
DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AND I

2346
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:39,155
THINK IT SOUNDS ATTRACTIVE TO A

00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:39,155



2348
00:47:38,888 --> 00:47:40,857
YOUNG VOTE.

2352
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:43,694
THE ROAD, AND I DON'T SEE HOW IT

2353
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:43,694



2354
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:44,627
COULD WORK. 

2355
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,627



2356
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:46,630

2358
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:47,463
THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS 

2359
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,463



2360
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:49,333
CONVERSATION DRAMATICALLY 

2361
00:47:47,463 --> 00:47:49,333



2362
00:47:47,597 --> 00:47:51,168
CHANGE, THIS REALLY WASN'T A 

2363
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,168



2364
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:51,868
TOPIC OF CONVERSATION IN THE 

2365
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:51,868



2366
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,203
DEMOCRATIC PARTY UNTIL BERNIE

2368
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:56,673
SANDERS HIT THE BIG STAGE AND

00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:56,673



2370
00:47:53,336 --> 00:47:57,340
NOW YOU SEE AOC DOING THE EXACT 

2371
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:57,340



2372
00:47:56,806 --> 00:47:59,676
SAME THING.

00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,676



2374
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:00,410
IN LESS THAN A YEAR SHE'S

00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:00,410



2376
00:47:59,809 --> 00:48:01,078
REVOLUTIONIZED THE CONVERSATION

00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:01,078



2378
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:02,579
AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE. 

2379
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:02,579



2380
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,613

00:48:02,712 --> 00:48:06,183
ATTEMPTED TO DO HAS FAILED.

2383
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:06,183



2384
00:48:03,746 --> 00:48:06,550

00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:10,187
WHAT I'M SAYING THE REALITY IS 

2389
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,187



2390
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:11,521
YOU LOOK AT THE PROCESS OF HOW 

2391
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:11,521



2392
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,956
YOU GET THESE THINGS DONE.

2393
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:12,956



2394
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:15,391
HOW DO YOU ACPLASH THIS?

00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:15,391



2396
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:16,393
IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT AND TO

00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:21,030
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO CHANGE.

2405
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:21,030



2406
00:48:20,663 --> 00:48:22,666
IT'S NOT REAL. 

2407
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:22,666



2408
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:26,169

2412
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:28,472

00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:30,640



2416
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:34,711
IT'S A BIG GENERATIONAL GAP, YOU

2570
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,026

2572
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:32,028
I'M JUST SAYING I THOUGHT SHE

2576
00:50:32,161 --> 00:50:37,400
HERSELF APART BY SAYING THAT THE

2580
00:50:37,533 --> 00:50:41,137
AND THAT IT WAS LEGISLATION TO 

2581
00:50:39,168 --> 00:50:41,137



2582
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:42,939

00:51:15,304 --> 00:51:16,572



2626
00:51:15,438 --> 00:51:18,641
THE COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE TO SAY

2627
00:51:16,572 --> 00:51:18,641



2628
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:21,077
ABOUT THEIR OWN HEALTHCARE PLAN.

2629
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:21,077



2630
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:21,944

00:51:21,944 --> 00:51:23,679



2634
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:26,683
I WANTED TO ASK SOMETHING THAT I

2635
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:26,683

SEGMENT.

2639
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,185



2640
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,986
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING THAT 

2641
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,986



2642
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:32,088
THE STUDENTS TALKED ABOUT CAME

00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:32,088



2644
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:33,857
DOWN TO AUTHENTICITY.

2645
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,857



2646
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:35,358
THIS IS A QUICK LIGHTNING ROUND.

2647
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:35,358

00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,231
AUTHENTIC?

00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:56,345



2678
00:51:55,044 --> 00:51:59,515
>> SO THINKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT,

00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:03,419
OF YOU SAID CASTRO SORT OF STOLE

2683
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:03,419



2684
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,088
THE SPOTLIGHT.

2685
00:52:03,419 --> 00:52:05,088



2686
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:06,989
WHAT -- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE 

2687
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,989



2688
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:07,290
TONIGHT THAT YOU DIDN'T SEE LAST

2689
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:07,290



2690
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:09,759
NIGHT?

2691
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,759



2692
00:52:07,423 --> 00:52:11,661
WHO DO YOU WANT TO SEE SHINE?

2693
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,661



2694
00:52:09,892 --> 00:52:12,996
WHAT TOPIC DO YOU THINK DIDN'T 

2695
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:12,996



2696
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,998
GET ENOUGH COVER?

2697
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:14,998



2698
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:16,933
>> DEFINITELY I FEEL LIKE THE 

2699
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:16,933



2700
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:18,901
CANDIDATES BARELY TOUCHED ON THE

2701
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:18,901



2702
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:20,437
ISSUE OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND

2703
00:52:18,901 --> 00:52:20,437



2704
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:21,438
HEARD A LOT ABOUT HEALTHCARE 

2705
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:21,438



2706
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,973
WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT AS 

2707
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:22,973



2708
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:25,108
WOMEN WE WANT TO HEAR ABOUT, 

2709
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,108



2710
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:27,543
ESPECIALLY WITH THE LAWS PASSED 

2711
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,543



2712
00:52:25,241 --> 00:52:28,644
RECENTLY, VERY HARSHLY LIMITING 

2713
00:52:27,543 --> 00:52:28,644



2714
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:31,414
WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE, I THINK

2715
00:52:28,644 --> 00:52:31,414



2716
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:32,849
THAT WE'RE ALL VERY INTERESTED 

2717
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:32,849



2718
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:34,351
IN JUST PROTECTING OR GOING 

2719
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,351



2720
00:52:32,982 --> 00:52:37,587
AGAINST THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND 

2721
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:37,587



2722
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:38,988
WHAT DOES IT REALLY MEAN TO 

2723
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:38,988



2724
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,322
MAYBE BE ANTI-ABORTION BUT PRO 

2725
00:52:38,988 --> 00:52:39,322



2726
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:40,624
CHOICE. 

2727
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,624



2728
00:52:39,455 --> 00:52:41,891
>> THAT'S AN INTERESTING POINT 

2729
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:41,891



2730
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:43,860
BECAUSE THIS IS AN HISTORIC 

2731
00:52:41,891 --> 00:52:43,860



2732
00:52:42,024 --> 00:52:46,262
NUMBER OF WOMEN THAT WE HAVE IN

00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:49,699
STAGE, HOW DO YOU THINK THAT 

2737
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,699



2738
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:51,400
MIGHT CHANGE THE CONVERSATION 

2739
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,400



2740
00:52:49,832 --> 00:52:51,734
AROUND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS 

2741
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:51,734

TONIGHT?

2743
00:52:51,734 --> 00:52:53,536



2744
00:52:51,867 --> 00:52:55,372
>> I THINK IT'S OPENING UP AGAIN

2745
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:55,372



2746
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,640
A UNIQUE CONVERSATION AS TO THE 

2747
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:56,640



2748
00:52:55,505 --> 00:53:00,777
RIGHTS THAT WOMEN MIGHT BE ABLE 

2749
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,777



2750
00:52:56,773 --> 00:53:02,078
TO HAVE OVER THEIR BODIES VERSUS

00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:02,078



2752
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,113
HOW ONE IDENTIFIES WITH THEIR

00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,113



2754
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:04,881
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HOW ONE 

2755
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:04,881



2756
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:06,816

00:53:05,014 --> 00:53:07,116
MIDDLE GROUND AS IT RELATES TO 

2759
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:07,116



2760
00:53:06,949 --> 00:53:08,684
THAT.

2761
00:53:07,116 --> 00:53:08,684



2762
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,587
IT'S ALSO OPENING UP ANOTHER 

2763
00:53:08,684 --> 00:53:10,587



2764
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:13,290
CONVERSATION AS TO THE ROLE THAT

2765

2766
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,723
MEN PLAY WITHIN THIS 

2767
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:13,723



2768
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:14,857
CONVERSATION.

00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:14,857



2770
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,660
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS AN ISSUE 

2771
00:53:14,857 --> 00:53:16,660



2772
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:18,528
THAT DIRECTLY AFFECTS WOMEN, WE 

2773
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,528



2774
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:20,163
ALL KNOW THAT WOMEN ARE NOT THE 

2775
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,163



2776
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:23,366
ONLY PEOPLE THAT ARE VOTING ON

2778
00:53:20,296 --> 00:53:27,370
THESE LAWS, SO IT THEN ALSO 

2779

2780
00:53:23,499 --> 00:53:28,938
BRINGS INTO THE CONVERSATION AS

00:53:28,938 --> 00:53:30,540



2784
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:32,275
TO PLAY WHEN IT COMES TO THE 

2785
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,275

2791
00:53:34,043 --> 00:53:36,145



2792
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:38,414
TALK ABOUT AND I DON'T THINK

00:53:36,145 --> 00:53:38,414



2794
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:41,251
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT ENOUGH, 

2795
00:53:38,414 --> 00:53:41,251



2796
00:53:38,547 --> 00:53:44,154
WE'VE DISCUSSED SORT OF THE

AND THINK OF SOMETHING NEW 

2803

2804
00:53:48,524 --> 00:53:49,992
APPROACH.

00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:49,992



2806
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:53,396
WHAT ABOUT BIPARTISANSHIP?

2807
00:53:49,992 --> 00:53:53,396



2808
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:58,367
DO YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY APPEAL 

2809
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:58,367

ACROSS THE AISLE A LITTLE BIT, 

2813
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,072



2814
00:54:00,603 --> 00:54:02,772
OR IS THAT NOT THE TIME FOR IT 

2815
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:02,772

00:54:05,441 --> 00:54:07,243



2820
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:09,545
WEST VIRGINIA WHERE I COME FROM

00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:09,545



2822
00:54:07,376 --> 00:54:14,116
USED TO BE A RELIABLY DEMOCRATIC

2823

01:26:09,663 --> 01:26:12,566
DECISIONSMI BASED ON WHETHER IT

01:26:32,519 --> 01:26:34,188



4889
01:26:32,653 --> 01:26:35,756
WHEN MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE

01:26:39,927 --> 01:26:41,162



4897
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:43,030
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE IF I

4899
01:26:41,295 --> 01:26:44,932
HADN'T HAD ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE.

4900
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:44,932



4901
01:26:43,164 --> 01:26:47,468
WHEN MY SON CAME HOME FROM IRAQ 

4902
01:26:44,932 --> 01:26:47,468



4903
01:26:45,065 --> 01:26:49,069

01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:53,808

01:26:52,306 --> 01:26:55,876
THE WAY, THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF

01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:55,876

4914
01:26:55,876 --> 01:26:56,944



4915
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:58,445
WE'RE CUTTING YOU OFF.

01:26:58,445 --> 01:27:00,381



4919
01:26:58,579 --> 01:27:02,783
THE FACT IS THE QUICKEST WAY TO 

4920
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:02,783

5904
01:43:56,863 --> 01:43:58,097
IT IS KIDNAPPING.

5905
01:43:57,530 --> 01:43:58,097



5906
01:43:57,664 --> 01:43:59,733

REALIZE THAT.

5911
01:44:00,266 --> 01:44:03,369

01:44:05,638 --> 01:44:10,376
IF YOU TAKE A LOT OF CHILDREN 

5919

5920
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:12,178

5926
01:44:12,679 --> 01:44:17,450
THIS IS COLLECTIVE CHILD ABUSE.

5927
01:44:15,615 --> 01:44:17,450



5928
01:44:15,749 --> 01:44:17,751

5934
01:44:19,486 --> 01:44:25,358

5935
01:44:21,154 --> 01:44:25,358



5936
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:25,958

02:14:10,108 --> 02:14:12,477
I AGREE WITH WHAT SENATOR 

7650
02:14:11,276 --> 02:14:12,477



7651
02:14:11,409 --> 02:14:13,311
GILLIBRAND WAS SAYING AND SHARE 

7652
02:14:12,477 --> 02:14:13,311



7653
02:14:12,610 --> 02:14:15,446
A LOT OF HER VIEWS.

7654
02:14:13,311 --> 02:14:15,446



7655
02:14:13,444 --> 02:14:17,249
WE NEED TO END GERRYMANDERING IN

7656
02:14:15,446 --> 02:14:17,249



7657
02:14:15,580 --> 02:14:18,383
WASHINGTON AND WE NEED TO END 

7658
02:14:17,249 --> 02:14:18,383



7659
02:14:17,382 --> 02:14:18,783
POLITICAL GERRYMANDERING IN 

7660
02:14:18,383 --> 02:14:18,783



7661
02:14:18,516 --> 02:14:19,784
WASHINGTON.

7662
02:14:18,783 --> 02:14:19,784



7663
02:14:18,916 --> 02:14:20,852
THE COURT TODAY SAID THEY 

7664
02:14:19,784 --> 02:14:20,852



7665
02:14:19,917 --> 02:14:23,421
COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

7666
02:14:20,852 --> 02:14:23,421



7667
02:14:20,985 --> 02:14:23,721
WE NEED TO OVERTURN CITIZENS 

7668
02:14:23,421 --> 02:14:23,721



7669
02:14:23,554 --> 02:14:25,390
UNIT.

7670
02:14:23,721 --> 02:14:25,390



7671
02:14:23,854 --> 02:14:27,759
THE COURT WAS THE ONE THAT GAVE 

7672
02:14:25,390 --> 02:14:27,759



7673
02:14:25,523 --> 02:14:29,528
US CITIZENS UNITED, AND THE 

7674
02:14:27,759 --> 02:14:29,528



7675
02:14:27,892 --> 02:14:31,028
ATTACK ON INVESTIGATE RIGHTS IN 

7676
02:14:29,528 --> 02:14:31,028



7677
02:14:29,661 --> 02:14:32,563
SHELBY VERSUS HOMER IS SOMETHING

7678
02:14:31,028 --> 02:14:32,563



7679
02:14:31,162 --> 02:14:34,900
THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH.

7680
02:14:32,563 --> 02:14:34,900



7681
02:14:32,697 --> 02:14:36,101
ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE 

7682
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:36,101



7683
02:14:35,033 --> 02:14:37,936
HAPPENED SINCE VICE PRESIDENT 

7684
02:14:36,101 --> 02:14:37,936



7685
02:14:36,234 --> 02:14:40,071
BIDEN WAS IN THE SENATE, AND 

7686
02:14:37,936 --> 02:14:40,071



7687
02:14:38,069 --> 02:14:42,541
WE'VE FACED STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS 

7688
02:14:40,071 --> 02:14:42,541



7689
02:14:40,204 --> 02:14:43,240
THAT WE HAVE TO OVERCOME WITH A 

7690
02:14:42,541 --> 02:14:43,240



7691
02:14:42,674 --> 02:14:45,243
BROAD COALITION.

7692
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:45,243



7693
02:14:43,374 --> 02:14:46,278
IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DO IT.

7694
02:14:45,243 --> 02:14:46,278



7695
02:14:45,376 --> 02:14:47,846
WE NEED TO ROOT OUT THE 

7696
02:14:46,278 --> 02:14:47,846



7697
02:14:46,411 --> 02:14:49,080
CORRUPTION IN WASHINGTON AND 

7698
02:14:47,846 --> 02:14:49,080



7699
02:14:47,979 --> 02:14:51,682
EXPAND PEOPLE'S RIGHTS TO GET TO

7700
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:51,682



7701
02:14:49,214 --> 02:14:52,049
POLLS AND I THINK THAT WE CAN 

7702
02:14:51,682 --> 02:14:52,049



7703
02:14:51,816 --> 02:14:54,352
SUCCEED. 

7704
02:14:52,049 --> 02:14:54,352



7705
02:14:52,183 --> 02:14:54,685
>> VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, 30 

7706
02:14:54,352 --> 02:14:54,685



7707
02:14:54,485 --> 02:14:57,189
SECONDS.

7708
02:14:54,685 --> 02:14:57,189



7709
02:14:54,819 --> 02:14:58,390
WHAT -- IT DOES SOUND AS IF YOU 

7710
02:14:57,189 --> 02:14:58,390



7711
02:14:57,322 --> 02:14:59,724
HAVEN'T SEEN WHAT'S BEEN 

7712
02:14:58,390 --> 02:14:59,724



7713
02:14:58,523 --> 02:15:01,426
HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES 

7714
02:14:59,724 --> 02:15:01,426



7715
02:14:59,858 --> 02:15:02,894
SENATE OVER THE LAST 12 YEARS.

7716
02:15:01,426 --> 02:15:02,894



7717
02:15:01,559 --> 02:15:04,529
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN, WHY?

7718
02:15:02,894 --> 02:15:04,529



7719
02:15:03,027 --> 02:15:06,063
>> I HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED.

7720
02:15:04,529 --> 02:15:06,063



7721
02:15:04,663 --> 02:15:08,633
JUST SINCE I WAS VICE PRESIDENT.

7722
02:15:06,063 --> 02:15:08,633



7723
02:15:06,197 --> 02:15:11,102
WE NEEDED THREE VOTES TO PASS AN

7724
02:15:08,633 --> 02:15:11,102



7725
02:15:08,766 --> 02:15:12,637
$800 BILLION RECOVERY ACT THAT 

7726
02:15:11,102 --> 02:15:12,637



7727
02:15:11,268 --> 02:15:13,037
KEPT US FROM GOING INTO A 

7728
02:15:12,637 --> 02:15:13,037



7729
02:15:12,770 --> 02:15:14,305
DEPRESSION.

7730
02:15:13,037 --> 02:15:14,305



7731
02:15:13,170 --> 02:15:16,040
I GOT THREE VOTES CHANGED.

7732
02:15:14,305 --> 02:15:16,040



7733
02:15:14,439 --> 02:15:17,275
WE NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE

7734
02:15:16,040 --> 02:15:17,275



7735
02:15:16,174 --> 02:15:17,875
GOVERNMENT FROM SHUTTING DOWN 

7736
02:15:17,275 --> 02:15:17,875



7737
02:15:17,409 --> 02:15:21,880
AND GOING BANKRUPT.

7738
02:15:17,875 --> 02:15:21,880



7739
02:15:18,009 --> 02:15:23,381
I GOT MITCH McCONNELL TO RAISE 

7740
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:23,381



7741
02:15:22,013 --> 02:15:27,352
TAXES $600 BILLION BY RAISING

THE TOP RATE, AND AS RECENTLY 

7744
02:15:27,352 --> 02:15:28,619



7745
02:15:27,485 --> 02:15:31,656
AFTER THE PRESIDENT GOT ELECTED 

7746
02:15:28,619 --> 02:15:31,656



7747
02:15:28,753 --> 02:15:32,891
I WAS ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER A 

7748
02:15:31,656 --> 02:15:32,891



7749
02:15:31,789 --> 02:15:35,159
COALITION THAT BILLIONS OF 

7750
02:15:32,891 --> 02:15:35,159



7751
02:15:33,024 --> 02:15:36,094
DOLLARS GO INTO CANCER RESEARCH,

7752
02:15:35,159 --> 02:15:36,094

02:15:35,293 --> 02:15:37,361
BIPARTISAN, BUT SOMETIMES YOU

02:15:36,094 --> 02:15:37,361



7755
02:15:36,227 --> 02:15:38,330
CAN'T DO THAT.

7756
02:15:37,361 --> 02:15:38,330



7757
02:15:37,495 --> 02:15:39,230
SOMETIMES YOU'VE GOT TO GO OUT 

7758
02:15:38,330 --> 02:15:39,230



7759
02:15:38,463 --> 02:15:42,033
AND BEAT THEM.

7760
02:15:39,230 --> 02:15:42,033



7761
02:15:39,364 --> 02:15:43,068
I WENT INTO 20 STATES, OVER 60 

7762
02:15:42,033 --> 02:15:43,068

BEAT THEM.

7766
02:15:43,702 --> 02:15:45,003



7767
02:15:43,835 --> 02:15:45,603
WE WON BACK THE SENATE. 

7768
02:15:45,003 --> 02:15:45,603



7769
02:15:45,136 --> 02:15:48,440
>> THANK YOU. 

7770
02:15:45,603 --> 02:15:48,440



7771
02:15:45,736 --> 02:15:49,173
>> CHUCK, THE PROBLEM WITH WHAT 

7772
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:49,173



7773
02:15:48,573 --> 02:15:51,009
THE VICE PRESIDENT -- 

7774
02:15:49,173 --> 02:15:51,009



7775
02:15:49,306 --> 02:15:53,044
>> 30 SECONDS, GO AHEAD. 

7776
02:15:51,009 --> 02:15:53,044



7777
02:15:51,142 --> 02:15:54,179
>> SOMETIMES YOU DO HAVE TO BEAT

7778
02:15:53,044 --> 02:15:54,179



7779
02:15:53,178 --> 02:15:55,580
THEM, BUT THE DEAL THAT HE 

7780
02:15:54,179 --> 02:15:55,580



7781
02:15:54,312 --> 02:15:57,515
TALKED ABOUT WITH MITCH 

7782
02:15:55,580 --> 02:15:57,515



7783
02:15:55,713 --> 02:15:58,650
McCONNELL WAS A COMPLETE VICTORY

7784
02:15:57,515 --> 02:15:58,650



7785
02:15:57,649 --> 02:16:02,120
FOR THE TEA PARTY.

7786
02:15:58,650 --> 02:16:02,120



7787
02:15:58,783 --> 02:16:02,520
IT EXTENDED THE BUSH TAX CUTS 

7788
02:16:02,120 --> 02:16:02,520



7789
02:16:02,253 --> 02:16:03,955
PERMANENTLY.

7790
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:03,955



7791
02:16:02,653 --> 02:16:05,924
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BEEN 

7792
02:16:03,955 --> 02:16:05,924



7793
02:16:04,088 --> 02:16:06,691
RUNNING AGAINST THAT FOR TEN 

7794
02:16:05,924 --> 02:16:06,691



7795
02:16:06,057 --> 02:16:08,560
YEARS.

7796
02:16:06,691 --> 02:16:08,560



7797
02:16:06,825 --> 02:16:10,729
WE'VE LOST THAT ECONOMIC 

7798
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:10,729



7799
02:16:08,693 --> 02:16:12,430
ARGUMENT BECAUSE THAT DEAL 

7800
02:16:10,729 --> 02:16:12,430



7801
02:16:10,862 --> 02:16:13,832
EXTEND ALMOST ALL THE BUSH TAX 

7802
02:16:12,430 --> 02:16:13,832



7803
02:16:12,563 --> 02:16:16,768
CUTS PERMANENTLY AND PUT IN 

7804
02:16:13,832 --> 02:16:16,768



7805
02:16:13,965 --> 02:16:20,071
PLACE THE MINDLESS CUTS THAT WE 

7806
02:16:16,768 --> 02:16:20,071



7807
02:16:16,901 --> 02:16:21,005
STILL ARE DEALING WITH TODAY 

7808
02:16:20,071 --> 02:16:21,005



7809
02:16:20,204 --> 02:16:22,507
THAT ARE CALLED THE SEQUESTER.

7810
02:16:21,005 --> 02:16:22,507



7811
02:16:21,139 --> 02:16:30,615
THAT WAS A GREAT DEAL FOR 

7812
02:16:22,507 --> 02:16:30,615



7813
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:32,817
MR. McCONNELL AND A TERRIBLE 

7814
02:16:30,615 --> 02:16:32,817



7815
02:16:30,749 --> 02:16:35,119
DEAL FOR AMERICA. 

7816
02:16:32,817 --> 02:16:35,119



7817
02:16:32,950 --> 02:16:36,254
>> THE REASON THE TRUMP TAX CUTS

7818
02:16:35,119 --> 02:16:36,254



7819
02:16:35,253 --> 02:16:37,822
WERE PASSED BECAUSE THEY HAD TO 

7820
02:16:36,254 --> 02:16:37,822



7821
02:16:36,387 --> 02:16:38,689
PAY BACK THE OWNERS, YOU HEARD 

7822
02:16:37,822 --> 02:16:38,689



7823
02:16:37,955 --> 02:16:40,258
THEM SAY THE WORDS.

7824
02:16:38,689 --> 02:16:40,258



7825
02:16:38,823 --> 02:16:42,861
THE CORRUPTION IN WASHINGTON IS 

7826
02:16:40,258 --> 02:16:42,861



7827
02:16:40,391 --> 02:16:43,561
REAL AND MAKES EVERY ONE OF THE 

7828
02:16:42,861 --> 02:16:43,561



7829
02:16:42,994 --> 02:16:44,462
PLANS THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT 

7830
02:16:43,561 --> 02:16:44,462



7831
02:16:43,695 --> 02:16:46,131
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS 

7832
02:16:44,462 --> 02:16:46,131



7833
02:16:44,596 --> 02:16:47,766
IMPOSSIBLE AND I HAVE THE MOST 

7834
02:16:46,131 --> 02:16:47,766



7835
02:16:46,264 --> 02:16:50,135
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO DO IT 

7836
02:16:47,766 --> 02:16:50,135



7837
02:16:47,899 --> 02:16:51,536
WITH CLEAN ELECTIONS, PUBLICLY 

7838
02:16:50,135 --> 02:16:51,536



7839
02:16:50,268 --> 02:16:52,737
FUND ELECTIONS.

7840
02:16:51,536 --> 02:16:52,737



7841
02:16:51,670 --> 02:16:54,538
WE RESTORE THE POWER OF 

7842
02:16:52,737 --> 02:16:54,538



7843
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:57,008
DEMOCRACY INTO THE HANDS OF THE 

7844
02:16:54,538 --> 02:16:57,008



7845
02:16:54,672 --> 02:16:57,375
VOTERS, NOT INTO THE KOCH 

7846
02:16:57,008 --> 02:16:57,375



7847
02:16:57,141 --> 02:17:00,344
BROTHERS.

7848

7883
02:17:25,670 --> 02:17:29,240
OF THE LAND SINCE 1973.

SEVERAL REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED 

7890
02:17:32,710 --> 02:17:34,012



7891
02:17:32,844 --> 02:17:35,113

02:17:35,480 --> 02:17:37,582

WHAT IS YOUR PLAN IF "ROE" IS 

7906

BELIEVES FOR A START THAT A 

7914
02:17:50,428 --> 02:17:52,496



7915
02:17:50,562 --> 02:17:55,934
WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CONTROL HER OWN

02:17:52,496 --> 02:17:55,934



7917
02:17:52,630 --> 02:17:57,168

7923
02:17:59,070 --> 02:18:02,140
RIGHT.

APPOINT ANY NOMINATION -- 

7940
02:18:15,220 --> 02:18:16,821

7949
02:18:22,527 --> 02:18:25,796
THIRD OF ALL, I DO NOT BELIEVE

7951
02:18:24,028 --> 02:18:28,633
IN PACKING THE COURT.

7952
02:18:25,796 --> 02:18:28,633



7953
02:18:25,930 --> 02:18:29,634
WE GOT A TERRIBLE 5-4 MAJORITY, 

7954
02:18:28,633 --> 02:18:29,634

7957
02:18:29,767 --> 02:18:34,005
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT 

7958
02:18:32,237 --> 02:18:34,005



7959
02:18:32,370 --> 02:18:37,575
CONSTITUTIONALLY WE HAVE THE

7967
02:18:41,079 --> 02:18:46,785
A MAJORITY I HOPE THAT WILL 

7968
02:18:45,083 --> 02:18:46,785

8027
02:19:34,065 --> 02:19:38,369

MIDWEST?

8268
02:22:53,731 --> 02:22:55,833



8269
02:22:53,865 --> 02:22:58,068

8272
02:22:58,068 --> 02:22:59,970



8273
02:22:58,202 --> 02:23:00,872
WE ALSO CAN'T SKIP A BEAT ON 

8274
02:22:59,970 --> 02:23:00,872



8275
02:23:00,104 --> 02:23:01,639
PREVENTING CLIMATE CHANGE FROM 

8276
02:23:00,872 --> 02:23:01,639



8277
02:23:01,005 --> 02:23:03,374
GETTING EVEN WORSE.

8278
02:23:01,639 --> 02:23:03,374



8279
02:23:01,772 --> 02:23:04,441
THAT'S WHY WE NEED AGGRESSIVE 

8280

8281
02:23:03,507 --> 02:23:06,010
AND AMBITIOUS MEASURES.

8282
02:23:04,441 --> 02:23:06,010



8283
02:23:04,575 --> 02:23:07,612
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO DO A 

8284
02:23:06,010 --> 02:23:07,612



8285
02:23:06,143 --> 02:23:09,347
CARBON TAX AND DIVIDEND, BUT I

8287
02:23:07,745 --> 02:23:11,082
WOULD PROPOSE WE DO IT IN A WAY 

8288
02:23:09,347 --> 02:23:11,082



8289
02:23:09,480 --> 02:23:12,482
THAT'S REBATED OUT TO THE 

8290
02:23:11,082 --> 02:23:12,482



8291
02:23:11,215 --> 02:23:13,885
AMERICAN PEOPLE IN A PROGRESSIVE

02:23:12,482 --> 02:23:13,885



8293
02:23:12,616 --> 02:23:15,352
FASHION SO THAT MOST AMERICANS 

8294
02:23:13,885 --> 02:23:15,352



8295
02:23:14,018 --> 02:23:17,188
ARE MADE MORE THAN WHOLE.

8296
02:23:15,352 --> 02:23:17,188



8297
02:23:15,486 --> 02:23:18,022
THIS ISN'T THEORETICAL FOR US IN

8298
02:23:17,188 --> 02:23:18,022



8299
02:23:17,321 --> 02:23:22,126
SOUTH BEND EITHER.

8300
02:23:18,022 --> 02:23:22,126



8301
02:23:18,156 --> 02:23:24,095
PARTS OF CALIFORNIA ON FIRE.

8302
02:23:22,126 --> 02:23:24,095



8303
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:26,463
RIGHT HERE IN FLORIDA THEY ARE 

8304
02:23:24,095 --> 02:23:26,463



8305
02:23:24,228 --> 02:23:29,167
TALKING ABOUT SHE LEVEL RISE.

8306
02:23:26,463 --> 02:23:29,167



8307
02:23:26,597 --> 02:23:30,635
I HAD TO ENACT THE EMERGENCY 

8308
02:23:29,167 --> 02:23:30,635



8309
02:23:29,300 --> 02:23:32,203
MEASURES IN OUR CITY, THE FIRST 

8310
02:23:30,635 --> 02:23:32,203



8311
02:23:30,768 --> 02:23:34,571
WAS A THOUSAND YEAR FLOOD AND 

8312
02:23:32,203 --> 02:23:34,571



8313
02:23:32,336 --> 02:23:35,473
THE NEXT WAS A 500-YEAR FLOOD.

8314
02:23:34,571 --> 02:23:35,473



8315
02:23:34,705 --> 02:23:36,673
THIS IS NOT JUST HAPPENING ON 

8316
02:23:35,473 --> 02:23:36,673



8317
02:23:35,606 --> 02:23:37,575
THE ARCTIC ICE CAPS.

8318
02:23:36,673 --> 02:23:37,575



8319
02:23:36,807 --> 02:23:39,009
THIS IS HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE 

8320
02:23:37,575 --> 02:23:39,009



8321
02:23:37,708 --> 02:23:40,544
OF THE COUNTRY AND WE'VE GOT TO 

8322
02:23:39,009 --> 02:23:40,544



8323
02:23:39,143 --> 02:23:41,612
BE DRAMATICALLY MORE AGGRESSIVE 

8324
02:23:40,544 --> 02:23:41,612



8325
02:23:40,678 --> 02:23:42,880
MOVING FORWARD.

8326
02:23:41,612 --> 02:23:42,880



8327
02:23:41,746 --> 02:23:43,181
HERE'S WHAT VERY FEW PEOPLE TALK

8328
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:43,181



8329
02:23:43,014 --> 02:23:45,115
ABOUT.

8330
02:23:43,181 --> 02:23:45,115



8331
02:23:43,314 --> 02:23:46,551
FIRST OF ALL, RURAL AMERICA CAN 

8332
02:23:45,115 --> 02:23:46,551



8333
02:23:45,249 --> 02:23:47,985
BE PART OF THE SOLUTION INSTEAD 

8334
02:23:46,551 --> 02:23:47,985



8335
02:23:46,684 --> 02:23:48,652
OF BEING TOLD THEY ARE PART OF 

8336
02:23:47,985 --> 02:23:48,652



8337
02:23:48,118 --> 02:23:52,156
THE PROBLEM.

8338
02:23:48,652 --> 02:23:52,156



8339
02:23:48,786 --> 02:23:53,056
WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF SOIL

MANAGEMENT RURAL MANAGEMENT 

8342
02:23:53,056 --> 02:23:54,425



8343
02:23:53,190 --> 02:23:55,859
COULD BE A HUGE PART OF HOW WE 

8344
02:23:54,425 --> 02:23:55,859



8345
02:23:54,558 --> 02:23:57,728
GET THIS DONE AND SECONDLY WE'VE

02:23:55,859 --> 02:23:57,728



8347
02:23:55,993 --> 02:23:58,462
GOT TO LOOK TO THE LEADERSHIP OF

8348
02:23:57,728 --> 02:23:58,462



8349
02:23:57,862 --> 02:23:59,897
LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

8350
02:23:58,462 --> 02:23:59,897



8351
02:23:58,595 --> 02:24:04,135
THE NETWORKS AND MAYORS AND 

8352
02:23:59,897 --> 02:24:04,135



8353
02:24:00,030 --> 02:24:04,935
CITIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT

02:24:04,135 --> 02:24:04,935



8355
02:24:04,268 --> 02:24:07,004
COME TOGETHER.

8356
02:24:04,935 --> 02:24:07,004



8357
02:24:05,102 --> 02:24:08,305
WE NEED TO HAVE A SUMMIT WHERE 

8358
02:24:07,004 --> 02:24:08,305



8359
02:24:07,137 --> 02:24:10,374
WE BRING THEM TOGETHER. 

8360
02:24:08,305 --> 02:24:10,374

YOU'VE SAID THAT OIL AND GAS 

8368
02:24:14,044 --> 02:24:15,546



8369
02:24:14,178 --> 02:24:17,548

8370
02:24:15,546 --> 02:24:17,548



8371
02:24:15,679 --> 02:24:18,982
THE SOLUTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE.

8372
02:24:17,548 --> 02:24:18,982

HAVE TALKED ABOUT MOVING AWAY 

8376
02:24:20,551 --> 02:24:22,453



8377
02:24:20,684 --> 02:24:24,121
FROM FOSSIL FUELS ENTIRELY.

8378
02:24:22,453 --> 02:24:24,121

8381
02:24:24,254 --> 02:24:28,259
REAL PARTNERS IN THIS FIGHT?

8382
02:24:25,957 --> 02:24:28,259

02:24:28,259 --> 02:24:28,592



8385
02:24:28,392 --> 02:24:32,296
URGENCY.

8386
02:24:28,592 --> 02:24:32,296



8387
02:24:28,726 --> 02:24:33,997
I'M A SCIENTIST SO I -- I

8391
02:24:34,131 --> 02:24:39,436
OF ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, SUFFERING

8392
02:24:37,735 --> 02:24:39,436



8393
02:24:37,869 --> 02:24:40,605
IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE, BUT, YOU 

8394
02:24:39,436 --> 02:24:40,605

GOVERNMENT JOB IS NOT GOING TO 

8398
02:24:42,173 --> 02:24:43,307

02:24:42,306 --> 02:24:44,675
GET US THERE.

8400
02:24:43,307 --> 02:24:44,675



8401
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:45,442
SOCIALISM IN THAT SENSE IS NOT 

8402
02:24:44,675 --> 02:24:45,442



8403
02:24:44,808 --> 02:24:47,278
THE SOLUTION.

8404
02:24:45,442 --> 02:24:47,278



8405
02:24:45,576 --> 02:24:49,212
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT REALLY 

8406
02:24:47,278 --> 02:24:49,212



8407
02:24:47,411 --> 02:24:51,215
WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

8408
02:24:49,212 --> 02:24:51,215



8409
02:24:49,346 --> 02:24:52,416
IN COLORADO WE'VE CLOSED A 

8410
02:24:51,215 --> 02:24:52,416



8411
02:24:51,348 --> 02:24:54,018
COUPLE OF COOL PLANTS AND 

8412
02:24:52,416 --> 02:24:54,018



8413
02:24:52,550 --> 02:24:55,486
REPLACED THEM WITH SOLAR AND 

8414
02:24:54,018 --> 02:24:55,486



8415
02:24:54,151 --> 02:24:56,954
WIND AND BATTERY AND MONTHLY 

8416
02:24:55,486 --> 02:24:56,954



8417
02:24:55,619 --> 02:24:58,288
BILLS HAVE GONE DOWN.

8418
02:24:56,954 --> 02:24:58,288



8419
02:24:57,088 --> 02:24:59,056
WE'RE BUILDING A NETWORK FOR 

8420
02:24:58,288 --> 02:24:59,056



8421
02:24:58,422 --> 02:25:00,558
ELECTRIC VEHICLES.

8422
02:24:59,056 --> 02:25:00,558



8423
02:24:59,190 --> 02:25:02,693
WE'RE WORKING WITH THE OIL AND 

8424
02:25:00,558 --> 02:25:02,693



8425
02:25:00,691 --> 02:25:04,394
GAS INDUSTRY, AND WE'VE CREATED 

8426
02:25:02,693 --> 02:25:04,394



8427
02:25:02,826 --> 02:25:05,362
THE FIRST METHANE REGULATIONS IN

8428
02:25:04,394 --> 02:25:05,362



8429
02:25:04,528 --> 02:25:08,165
THE COUNTRY.

8430
02:25:05,362 --> 02:25:08,165



8431
02:25:05,496 --> 02:25:10,301
METHANE IS 25 TIMES WORSE THAN 

8432
02:25:08,165 --> 02:25:10,301



8433
02:25:08,299 --> 02:25:11,569
CO2 AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO GET TO

8434
02:25:10,301 --> 02:25:11,569



8435
02:25:10,434 --> 02:25:12,603
THE LAST PART, THE HEAVY 

8436
02:25:11,569 --> 02:25:12,603



8437
02:25:11,702 --> 02:25:13,737
INDUSTRIAL INDUSTRIES, WE 

8438
02:25:12,603 --> 02:25:13,737



8439
02:25:12,736 --> 02:25:15,405
HAVEN'T SEEN THE PLANS YET.

8440
02:25:13,737 --> 02:25:15,405



8441
02:25:13,871 --> 02:25:17,675
IF YOU LOOK AT THE REAL 

8442
02:25:15,405 --> 02:25:17,675



8443
02:25:15,539 --> 02:25:21,579
PROBLEMS, CO2, THE WORST 

8444
02:25:17,675 --> 02:25:21,579



8445
02:25:17,808 --> 02:25:23,914
POLLUTERS OF CO2 IS CHINA, THE

02:25:21,712 --> 02:25:26,984
UNITED STATES AND CONCRETE AND

8498
02:26:03,387 --> 02:26:05,255

9345
02:42:26,770 --> 02:42:30,139
I THINK IT CAN BE DONE, AND IT

9347
02:42:28,371 --> 02:42:33,242

MAYBE THEY COULD SHARE ONE.

9697
02:47:05,648 --> 02:47:10,620
I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING

9705
02:47:12,454 --> 02:47:15,825
I ALSO THINK WE SHOULD NOT HAVE

IT'S HONG OVERDUE.

02:47:16,926 --> 02:47:19,562



9711
02:47:17,060 --> 02:47:21,030
IT SHOULD END, AND THIRDLY I 

9712
02:47:19,562 --> 02:47:21,030



9713
02:47:19,695 --> 02:47:23,099
BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

02:47:21,030 --> 02:47:23,099



9715
02:47:21,164 --> 02:47:24,833
FIND ANYBODY WHO HAS PULLED

02:47:24,833 --> 02:47:28,938



9719
02:47:24,967 --> 02:47:30,106
TO DEAL WITH WHAT IS THE REAL 

9720
02:47:28,938 --> 02:47:30,106



9721
02:47:29,071 --> 02:47:32,341
STATED THREAT OUT THERE.

9725
02:47:32,475 --> 02:47:35,278
DEALING WITH TERRORISM SO I

9727
02:47:33,643 --> 02:47:38,548
WOULD ELIMINATE THE ACT THAT 

9728
02:47:35,278 --> 02:47:38,548



9729
02:47:35,411 --> 02:47:40,650
ALLOWED US TO GO INTO WAR AND 

9730
02:47:38,548 --> 02:47:40,650



9731
02:47:38,681 --> 02:47:43,252
NOT THE AMF AND MAKE SURE THAT 

9732
02:47:40,650 --> 02:47:43,252



9733
02:47:40,783 --> 02:47:45,488
IT CAN ONLY BE USED FOR WHAT ITS

9734
02:47:43,252 --> 02:47:45,488



9735
02:47:43,386 --> 02:47:47,890
INTENT WAS, AND THAT IS TO GO

9741
02:47:48,324 --> 02:47:50,960
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO REPAIR OUR

9743
02:47:50,593 --> 02:47:53,296

03:07:38,146 --> 03:07:39,781
ON EARTH.

10831
03:07:38,413 --> 03:07:39,781



10832
03:07:38,547 --> 03:07:41,583
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

10833
03:07:39,781 --> 03:07:41,583



10834
03:07:39,915 --> 03:07:42,784
>> HERE TO HELP ME DIVE IN TO 

10835
03:07:41,583 --> 03:07:42,784



10836
03:07:41,716 --> 03:07:46,354
ALL OF THOSE ISSUES WE HEARD 

10837
03:07:42,784 --> 03:07:46,354

WE HAVE NANCY SANTIAGO, AND 

10841
03:07:53,628 --> 03:07:54,529

10844
03:07:54,662 --> 03:08:01,436
WHO DO YOU THINK WON THE DEBATE 

10845
03:07:56,164 --> 03:08:01,436



10846
03:07:56,298 --> 03:08:03,371
TONIGHT, ALEX?

10847
03:08:01,436 --> 03:08:03,371



10848
03:08:01,570 --> 03:08:07,275
>> IT WAS KAMALA HARRIS AND THAT

10849
03:08:03,371 --> 03:08:07,275



10850
03:08:03,504 --> 03:08:10,244
EXCHANGE SHE HAD WITH JOE BIDEN 

10851
03:08:07,275 --> 03:08:10,244



10852
03:08:07,408 --> 03:08:10,611
WAS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BE 

10853
03:08:10,244 --> 03:08:10,611



10854
03:08:10,378 --> 03:08:13,782
DISCUSSED.

10855
03:08:10,611 --> 03:08:13,782



10856
03:08:10,745 --> 03:08:16,284
IT'S NOT EVEN OVER, KAMALA'S 

10857
03:08:13,782 --> 03:08:16,284



10858
03:08:13,915 --> 03:08:17,418
CAMPAIGN IS SAYING THAT BIDEN 

10859
03:08:16,284 --> 03:08:17,418



10860
03:08:16,417 --> 03:08:19,654
NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE.

10861
03:08:17,418 --> 03:08:19,654



10862
03:08:17,552 --> 03:08:23,925
AND THERE'S AN OPEN QUESTION, 

10863
03:08:19,654 --> 03:08:23,925



10864
03:08:19,787 --> 03:08:24,693
BIDEN IN THEIR DEFENDED HIS 

10865
03:08:23,925 --> 03:08:24,693



10866
03:08:24,058 --> 03:08:28,864
PASSED VIEWS.

10867
03:08:24,693 --> 03:08:28,864



10868
03:08:24,826 --> 03:08:31,299
THAT IS NOT CLEAR, THEY ARE 

10869
03:08:28,864 --> 03:08:31,299



10870
03:08:28,997 --> 03:08:31,999
GOING TO KEEP PUSHING HIM TO 

10871
03:08:31,299 --> 03:08:31,999



10872
03:08:31,432 --> 03:08:34,336
CHANGE HIS POSITION.

10873
03:08:31,999 --> 03:08:34,336



10874
03:08:32,133 --> 03:08:34,402
>> DO YOU THINK HE WAS RIGHT TO 

10875
03:08:34,336 --> 03:08:34,402



10876
03:08:34,402 --> 03:08:35,771



10877
03:08:34,502 --> 03:08:36,804
DOUBLE DOWN WHEN SHE HELD HIS 

10878
03:08:35,771 --> 03:08:36,804



10879
03:08:35,904 --> 03:08:37,939
FEET TO THE FIRE?

10880
03:08:36,804 --> 03:08:37,939



10881
03:08:36,938 --> 03:08:39,207
>> NO, HE WAS WRONG.

10882
03:08:37,939 --> 03:08:39,207



10883
03:08:38,073 --> 03:08:41,643
HE IS WRONG.

10884
03:08:39,207 --> 03:08:41,643



10885
03:08:39,341 --> 03:08:42,577
AND SHE ARTICULATED 

10886
03:08:41,643 --> 03:08:42,577



10887
03:08:41,776 --> 03:08:44,045
FUNDAMENTALLY A REALLY IMPORTANT

10888
03:08:42,577 --> 03:08:44,045



10889
03:08:42,711 --> 03:08:47,048
DEBATE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, 

10890
03:08:44,045 --> 03:08:47,048



10891
03:08:44,179 --> 03:08:48,817
WHICH IS THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL

10892
03:08:47,048 --> 03:08:48,817



10893
03:08:47,182 --> 03:08:51,286
GOVERNMENT WHEN IT STEPS IN.

10894
03:08:48,817 --> 03:08:51,286



10895
03:08:48,950 --> 03:08:53,889
WHEN THE STATES ARE NOT DOING 

10896
03:08:51,286 --> 03:08:53,889



10897
03:08:51,419 --> 03:08:59,794
WHAT THE SUPREME COURT SAYS IT 

10898
03:08:53,889 --> 03:08:59,794



10899
03:08:54,022 --> 03:09:02,163
SHOULD DO, RIGHT?

10900
03:08:59,794 --> 03:09:02,163



10901
03:08:59,928 --> 03:09:02,997
SO, HER POINT ON THE SUBSTANCE 

10902
03:09:02,163 --> 03:09:02,997



10903
03:09:02,297 --> 03:09:04,599
IS CORRECT.

10904
03:09:02,997 --> 03:09:04,599



10905
03:09:03,131 --> 03:09:06,000
SO, HE WAS WRONG IN THAT MOMENT 

10906
03:09:04,599 --> 03:09:06,000



10907
03:09:04,732 --> 03:09:07,869
AND WRONG TO DOUBLE DOWN.

10908
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:07,869



10909
03:09:06,134 --> 03:09:09,037
>> AND THEN YOU WERE THERE LAST 

10910
03:09:07,869 --> 03:09:09,037



10911
03:09:08,003 --> 03:09:09,604
NIGHT IN MIAMI CORRECT?

10912
03:09:09,037 --> 03:09:09,604



10913
03:09:09,170 --> 03:09:11,406
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

10914
03:09:09,604 --> 03:09:11,406



10915
03:09:09,737 --> 03:09:14,108
>> ONE THING I COULD NOT HELP 

10916
03:09:11,406 --> 03:09:14,108



10917
03:09:11,539 --> 03:09:15,242
BUT NOTICE WAS THE WAY THAT 

10918
03:09:14,108 --> 03:09:15,242



10919
03:09:14,242 --> 03:09:16,077
IDENTITY POLITICS WAS TREATED 

10920
03:09:15,242 --> 03:09:16,077



10921
03:09:15,376 --> 03:09:18,446
TONIGHT VERSE LAST NIGHT.

10922
03:09:16,077 --> 03:09:18,446



10923
03:09:16,211 --> 03:09:20,148
TO ME, AND TELL ME IF I'M WRONG,

10924
03:09:18,446 --> 03:09:20,148



10925
03:09:18,580 --> 03:09:20,848
IT FELT LIKE LAST NIGHT WAS MORE

10926
03:09:20,148 --> 03:09:20,848



10927
03:09:20,282 --> 03:09:22,984
ABOUT WHO I AM.

10928
03:09:20,848 --> 03:09:22,984



10929
03:09:20,982 --> 03:09:24,419
AND TONIGHT, IT WAS MORE OF WHAT

10930
03:09:22,984 --> 03:09:24,419



10931
03:09:23,117 --> 03:09:26,221
I HAVE SPECIALSED.

10932
03:09:24,419 --> 03:09:26,221



10933
03:09:24,553 --> 03:09:27,255
YOU SAW THE CANDIDATES CONNECT 

10934
03:09:26,221 --> 03:09:27,255



10935
03:09:26,354 --> 03:09:29,424
ON THINGS LIKE HEALTH CARE.

10936
03:09:27,255 --> 03:09:29,424



10937
03:09:27,389 --> 03:09:30,725
I HAD A SICK DAD OR A TERMINAL 

10938
03:09:29,424 --> 03:09:30,725



10939
03:09:29,557 --> 03:09:33,595
ILLNESS AND IT SEEMED TO BE 

10940
03:09:30,725 --> 03:09:33,595



10941
03:09:30,858 --> 03:09:33,995
ABOUT THE MARROW OF THEIR 

10942
03:09:33,595 --> 03:09:33,995



10943
03:09:33,729 --> 03:09:35,664
EXPERIENCES.

10944
03:09:33,995 --> 03:09:35,664



10945
03:09:34,129 --> 03:09:38,433
DO YOU THINK THAT AFFECTED WHY 

10946
03:09:35,664 --> 03:09:38,433



10947
03:09:35,797 --> 03:09:38,900
THAT MOMENT WITH KAMALA WAS SO 

10948
03:09:38,433 --> 03:09:38,900



10949
03:09:38,567 --> 03:09:40,067
POWERFUL?

10950
03:09:38,900 --> 03:09:40,067



10951
03:09:39,034 --> 03:09:42,437
>> I DON'T THINK IT WAS THAT PER

10952
03:09:40,067 --> 03:09:42,437



10953
03:09:40,201 --> 03:09:43,938
SAY FOR ME, THERE WAS IDENTITY 

10954
03:09:42,437 --> 03:09:43,938



10955
03:09:42,570 --> 03:09:45,006
POLITICS LAST NIGHT.

10956
03:09:43,938 --> 03:09:45,006



10957
03:09:44,072 --> 03:09:45,573
AND IT WAS AROUND THE 

10958
03:09:45,006 --> 03:09:45,573



10959
03:09:45,139 --> 03:09:48,276
IMMIGRATION PIECE.

10960
03:09:45,573 --> 03:09:48,276



10961
03:09:45,707 --> 03:09:49,277
IT'S NOT BLACK AND WHITE, RIGHT?

10962
03:09:48,276 --> 03:09:49,277



10963
03:09:48,410 --> 03:09:52,881
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THING.

10964
03:09:49,277 --> 03:09:52,881



10965
03:09:49,410 --> 03:09:54,416
SO IN THAT RESPECT, THAT WAS A 

10966
03:09:52,881 --> 03:09:54,416



10967
03:09:53,014 --> 03:09:55,951
HEATED EXCHANGE BETWEEN -- SO, 

10968
03:09:54,416 --> 03:09:55,951



10969
03:09:54,549 --> 03:09:57,585
WE THINK ABOUT THAT PIECE, IT'S 

10970
03:09:55,951 --> 03:09:57,585



10971
03:09:56,084 --> 03:10:00,421
JUST PLAYING OUT DIFFERENTLY.

10972
03:09:57,585 --> 03:10:00,421



10973
03:09:57,719 --> 03:10:01,756
WHAT I THINK THE PROBLEM, OR THE

10974
03:10:00,421 --> 03:10:01,756



10975
03:10:00,555 --> 03:10:04,192
MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR BIDEN 

10976
03:10:01,756 --> 03:10:04,192



10977
03:10:01,890 --> 03:10:06,694
WAS, HE HAD A CHANCE TO MODEL 

10978
03:10:04,192 --> 03:10:06,694



10979
03:10:04,325 --> 03:10:12,300
FOR AMERICA HOW TO SAY, I AM 

10980
03:10:06,694 --> 03:10:12,300



10981
03:10:06,827 --> 03:10:13,835
SORRY, LET'S FIX THIS.

10982
03:10:12,300 --> 03:10:13,835



10983
03:10:12,434 --> 03:10:14,369
BECAUS -- BECAUSE SHE SAID, I 

10984
03:10:13,835 --> 03:10:14,369



10985
03:10:13,969 --> 03:10:16,071
WAS HURT PERSONALLY.

10986
03:10:14,369 --> 03:10:16,071



10987
03:10:14,536 --> 03:10:17,505
IT WAS HIS MOMENT TO SHOW HOW 

10988
03:10:16,071 --> 03:10:17,505



10989
03:10:16,204 --> 03:10:18,072
YOU COME TOGETHER, HE SAID IT, 

10990
03:10:17,505 --> 03:10:18,072



10991
03:10:17,638 --> 03:10:19,441
I'M THE BRIDGE.

10992
03:10:18,072 --> 03:10:19,441



10993
03:10:18,206 --> 03:10:22,076
DO THAT, AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN 

10994
03:10:19,441 --> 03:10:22,076



10995
03:10:19,574 --> 03:10:24,913
IN THE EXCHANGE.

10996
03:10:22,076 --> 03:10:24,913



10997
03:10:22,210 --> 03:10:26,314
>> I THINK SHE SPOKE TORE OTHER 

10998
03:10:24,913 --> 03:10:26,314



10999
03:10:25,046 --> 03:10:29,551
BLACK PEOPLE TOO.

11000
03:10:26,314 --> 03:10:29,551



11001
03:10:26,448 --> 03:10:31,653
SAYING IT WAS HURTFUL.

11002
03:10:29,551 --> 03:10:31,653



11003
03:10:29,684 --> 03:10:34,222
WE ARE JUST SAYING THAT YOU 

11004
03:10:31,653 --> 03:10:34,222

KNOW, YOUR WORDS HAD AN IMPACT 

11006
03:10:34,222 --> 03:10:34,923



11007
03:10:34,356 --> 03:10:36,424
IN A NEGATIVE WAY, BECAUSE IT 

11008
03:10:34,923 --> 03:10:36,424



11009
03:10:35,056 --> 03:10:37,592
SEEMED THAT YOU DID NOT 

11010
03:10:36,424 --> 03:10:37,592

03:10:36,557 --> 03:10:38,226
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WERE SAY IN 

11012
03:10:37,592 --> 03:10:38,226



11013
03:10:37,725 --> 03:10:41,062
THE MOMENT.

11014
03:10:38,226 --> 03:10:41,062



11015
03:10:38,359 --> 03:10:41,963
YOU ARE COMPLIMENTING, NOT 

11016
03:10:41,062 --> 03:10:41,963



11017
03:10:41,196 --> 03:10:46,134

CLEAR, BUT SAYING SOMETHING 

11020
03:10:46,134 --> 03:10:47,835



11021
03:10:46,267 --> 03:10:47,902
COMPLIMENTARY ABOUT

11024
03:10:48,002 --> 03:10:49,571
SEGREGATIONIST, SEEMS LIKE

03:17:05,279 --> 03:17:07,915
PRIVATE INSURANCE.

11418
03:17:05,680 --> 03:17:07,915



11419
03:17:05,813 --> 03:17:09,283
THAT IS POINT ONE.

11420
03:17:07,915 --> 03:17:09,283



11421
03:17:08,049 --> 03:17:10,752
BUT GOOD FOR HONESTY AND WHAT 

11422
03:17:09,283 --> 03:17:10,752



11423
03:17:09,417 --> 03:17:12,219
THEY ARE MISSING, THERE'S A LOT 

11424
03:17:10,752 --> 03:17:12,219



11425
03:17:10,885 --> 03:17:13,721
OF PEOPLE, AS BERNIE SAID 

11426
03:17:12,219 --> 03:17:13,721



11427
03:17:12,353 --> 03:17:14,655
TONIGHT, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE

11428
03:17:13,721 --> 03:17:14,655



11429
03:17:13,854 --> 03:17:15,389
THAT HATE PRIVATE INSURANCE.

11430
03:17:14,655 --> 03:17:15,389



11431
03:17:14,789 --> 03:17:16,891
THAT IS TRUE.

11432
03:17:15,389 --> 03:17:16,891



11433
03:17:15,523 --> 03:17:17,192
I HEAR FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE

11434
03:17:16,891 --> 03:17:17,192



11435
03:17:17,025 --> 03:17:18,592
THAT.

11436
03:17:17,192 --> 03:17:18,592



11437
03:17:17,325 --> 03:17:19,893
AND THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT

11438
03:17:18,592 --> 03:17:19,893



11439
03:17:18,726 --> 03:17:21,495
LIKE THE INSURANCE THAT THEY 

11440
03:17:19,893 --> 03:17:21,495



11441
03:17:20,027 --> 03:17:23,398
HAVE AND WANT TO KEEP IT AND I 

11442
03:17:21,495 --> 03:17:23,398



11443
03:17:21,629 --> 03:17:25,166
THINK, IF THE OBJECTIVE IS TO 

11444
03:17:23,398 --> 03:17:25,166



11445
03:17:23,531 --> 03:17:27,368
GET TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE 

11446
03:17:25,166 --> 03:17:27,368



11447
03:17:25,299 --> 03:17:28,636
COVERAGE AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN, 

11448
03:17:27,368 --> 03:17:28,636



11449
03:17:27,501 --> 03:17:30,104
GIVING PEOPLE AN OPTION TO 

11450
03:17:28,636 --> 03:17:30,104



11451
03:17:28,769 --> 03:17:31,839
CHOOSE FOR THEIR FAMILY, I THINK

11452
03:17:30,104 --> 03:17:31,839



11453
03:17:30,238 --> 03:17:33,240
IS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO BE THE 

11454
03:17:31,839 --> 03:17:33,240



11455
03:17:31,972 --> 03:17:34,842
FASTEST WAY.

11456
03:17:33,240 --> 03:17:34,842



11457
03:17:33,374 --> 03:17:36,777
I THINK WE WILL BE DEAD BEFORE 

11458
03:17:34,842 --> 03:17:36,777



11459
03:17:34,975 --> 03:17:45,420
WE TAKE IT AWAY FROM PEOPLE THAT

11460
03:17:36,777 --> 03:17:45,420



11461
03:17:36,911 --> 03:17:45,854

THEIR FAMILY.

11464
03:17:45,854 --> 03:17:47,521



11465
03:17:45,987 --> 03:17:49,389
>> THERE'S A SURPRISE FROM 

11466
03:17:47,521 --> 03:17:49,389



11467
03:17:47,655 --> 03:17:52,794
SENATOR HARRIS RAISING HER HAND 

11468
03:17:49,389 --> 03:17:52,794



11469
03:17:49,523 --> 03:17:53,795
FOR THE RESPONSE AND I THINK 

11470
03:17:52,794 --> 03:17:53,795



11471
03:17:52,927 --> 03:17:54,662
THERE'S A CONCERN, WHAT IMPACT 

11472
03:17:53,795 --> 03:17:54,662



11473
03:17:53,928 --> 03:17:55,896
DOES IT HAVE?

11474
03:17:54,662 --> 03:17:55,896



11475
03:17:54,796 --> 03:17:58,532
>> I WAS NOT SURPRISED.

11476
03:17:55,896 --> 03:17:58,532



11477
03:17:56,030 --> 03:18:00,167
I THINK SHE IS FOR IT AND SHE 

11478
03:17:58,532 --> 03:18:00,167



11479
03:17:58,666 --> 03:18:01,635
SAID THAT SHE WANTS IT.

11480
03:18:00,167 --> 03:18:01,635



11481
03:18:00,301 --> 03:18:04,072
IN STATES LIKE COLORADO, AND 

11482
03:18:01,635 --> 03:18:04,072

11489
03:18:10,744 --> 03:18:13,114
HARD TIME IF THE POSITION IS 

11490
03:18:12,079 --> 03:18:13,114



11491
03:18:12,212 --> 03:18:15,449
THAT WE ARE GOING TO TAKE 

11492
03:18:13,114 --> 03:18:15,449



11493
03:18:13,247 --> 03:18:15,783

11495
03:18:15,583 --> 03:18:17,685
PEOPLE.

11496

11497
03:18:15,916 --> 03:18:18,519
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE

11498
03:18:17,685 --> 03:18:18,519



11499
03:18:17,819 --> 03:18:19,820
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

11500
03:18:18,519 --> 03:18:19,820



11501
03:18:18,653 --> 03:18:21,355
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID IF YOU LIKE

11502
03:18:19,820 --> 03:18:21,355



11503
03:18:19,954 --> 03:18:23,257
YOUR INSURANCE, YOU CAN KEEP IT.

11504
03:18:21,355 --> 03:18:23,257



11505
03:18:21,488 --> 03:18:25,026
A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF 

11506

11507
03:18:23,390 --> 03:18:27,428
PEOPLE LOST IT BECAUSE OF THE 

11508
03:18:25,026 --> 03:18:27,428



11509
03:18:25,159 --> 03:18:27,729
WAY THAT THE SYSTEM CAME IN TO 

11510
03:18:27,428 --> 03:18:27,729



11511
03:18:27,562 --> 03:18:29,229
PLACE.

11512
03:18:27,729 --> 03:18:29,229



11513
03:18:27,862 --> 03:18:29,596
AND THAT WAS A POLITICAL 

11514
03:18:29,229 --> 03:18:29,596



11515
03:18:29,363 --> 03:18:31,031
DISASTER.

11516
03:18:29,596 --> 03:18:31,031



11517
03:18:29,730 --> 03:18:31,532

11518

11521
03:18:31,666 --> 03:18:34,702
SO, IMAGINE A SITUATION WHERE, 

11522
03:18:33,167 --> 03:18:34,702



11523
03:18:33,301 --> 03:18:36,370
WHAT WE ARE SAYING TO PEOPLE IS,

11524
03:18:34,702 --> 03:18:36,370



11525
03:18:34,836 --> 03:18:38,405
IF YOU LIKE YOUR INSURANCE, WE 

11526
03:18:36,370 --> 03:18:38,405

11529
03:18:38,539 --> 03:18:40,074
YOU.

11530
03:18:38,706 --> 03:18:40,074



11531
03:18:38,839 --> 03:18:41,175
THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WHAT WE 

11532
03:18:40,074 --> 03:18:41,175



11533
03:18:40,207 --> 03:18:43,043
SHOULD BE ARGUING.

11534
03:18:41,175 --> 03:18:43,043



11535
03:18:41,309 --> 03:18:44,078
WHAT WE SHOULD BE ARGUING IS FOR

03:18:43,043 --> 03:18:44,078



11537
03:18:43,177 --> 03:18:45,546

11539
03:18:44,212 --> 03:18:46,580
AND WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT THROUGH 

11540
03:18:45,546 --> 03:18:46,580



11541
03:18:45,680 --> 03:18:49,016
A PUBLIC OPTION AND I THINK WE 

11542
03:18:46,580 --> 03:18:49,016



11543
03:18:46,714 --> 03:18:50,618

AND BY THE WAY, EVERYBODY WHO

DO YOU BELIEVE THAT TWO MEN IN 

11562
03:19:06,100 --> 03:19:07,869



11563
03:19:06,233 --> 03:19:08,703
THE MIDDLE OF THAT STAGE SHOULD 

11564
03:19:07,869 --> 03:19:08,703



11565
03:19:08,002 --> 03:19:14,174

11569

11571
03:19:15,943 --> 03:19:20,982
THE END, 40 YEARS OF IMMOBILITY

11577
03:19:23,517 --> 03:19:25,920
AND IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THAT.

11578
03:19:24,552 --> 03:19:25,920



11579
03:19:24,685 --> 03:19:26,987
I AGREE WITH THAT.

IN HERE TONIGHT.

12201
03:37:10,316 --> 03:37:11,551



12202
03:37:10,450 --> 03:37:12,785
A LOT OF HOT PICKS.

12203
03:37:11,551 --> 03:37:12,785



12204
03:37:11,685 --> 03:37:14,454
AND I WILL ASK FOR THEM NOW.

12205
03:37:12,785 --> 03:37:14,454



12206
03:37:12,918 --> 03:37:16,089
YOU HAD A LOT TO SAY WHEN WE 

12207
03:37:14,454 --> 03:37:16,089



12208
03:37:14,587 --> 03:37:18,591
WERE WATCHING AND I WANT THE TOP

12209
03:37:16,089 --> 03:37:18,591



12210
03:37:16,223 --> 03:37:20,927
LINE REACTIONS RIGHT NOW.

12211
03:37:18,591 --> 03:37:20,927



12212
03:37:18,725 --> 03:37:22,896
WHAT STOOD OUT AND WHAT WAS THE 

12213
03:37:20,927 --> 03:37:22,896



12214
03:37:21,061 --> 03:37:24,430
TAKE ON THE DEBATE OVERALL, 

12215
03:37:22,896 --> 03:37:24,430



12216
03:37:23,029 --> 03:37:27,500
COMPARED TO LAST NIGHT?

12217
03:37:24,430 --> 03:37:27,500



12218
03:37:24,564 --> 03:37:30,870
>> I THINK VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN 

12219
03:37:27,500 --> 03:37:30,870



12220
03:37:27,634 --> 03:37:31,537
AND SENATOR -- BUCKLED UNDER THE

12221
03:37:30,870 --> 03:37:31,537



12222
03:37:31,004 --> 03:37:33,607
PRESSURE.

12223
03:37:31,537 --> 03:37:33,607



12224
03:37:31,671 --> 03:37:35,608
WHEN THE HEAT WAS TURNED UP, 

12225
03:37:33,607 --> 03:37:35,608



12226
03:37:33,740 --> 03:37:37,744
THEY COULD NOT HOLD THEIR OWN.

12227
03:37:35,608 --> 03:37:37,744



12228
03:37:35,742 --> 03:37:39,245
THAT WAS BIG, AND FOR SOMEBODY 

12229
03:37:37,744 --> 03:37:39,245



12230
03:37:37,878 --> 03:37:41,480
LIKE VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, HE 

12231
03:37:39,245 --> 03:37:41,480



12232
03:37:39,379 --> 03:37:42,448
IS, YOU KNOW, KAMALA HARRIS WAS 

12233
03:37:41,480 --> 03:37:42,448



12234
03:37:41,614 --> 03:37:43,483
TOUGH ON HIM TONIGHT.

12235
03:37:42,448 --> 03:37:43,483



12236
03:37:42,582 --> 03:37:45,518
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE TOUGH ON 

12237
03:37:43,483 --> 03:37:45,518



12238
03:37:43,616 --> 03:37:46,786
HIM IN A GENERAL ELECTION.

12239
03:37:45,518 --> 03:37:46,786



12240
03:37:45,652 --> 03:37:50,022
WILL HE HANDLE THAT?

12241
03:37:46,786 --> 03:37:50,022



12242
03:37:46,920 --> 03:37:51,191
>> SPEAKING OF KAMALA HARRIS.

12243
03:37:50,022 --> 03:37:51,191



12244
03:37:50,156 --> 03:37:52,826
I FELT THAT EVEN THOUGH TONIGHT 

12245
03:37:51,191 --> 03:37:52,826



12246
03:37:51,324 --> 03:37:56,296
A LOT OF THE CANDIDATES WERE 

12247
03:37:52,826 --> 03:37:56,296



12248
03:37:52,959 --> 03:37:58,465
ABLE TO COME AT JOE BIDEN FOR 

12249
03:37:56,296 --> 03:37:58,465



12250
03:37:56,429 --> 03:38:00,767
HIS CONTROVERSIAL PAST, I THINK 

12251
03:37:58,465 --> 03:38:00,767



12252
03:37:58,598 --> 03:38:03,003
THAT KAMALA BENEFITTED FROM 

12253
03:38:00,767 --> 03:38:03,003



12254
03:38:00,900 --> 03:38:04,537
PEOPLE NOT PICKING UP ON HER 

12255
03:38:03,003 --> 03:38:04,537



12256
03:38:03,136 --> 03:38:06,506
PAST AS SHE TALKED ABOUT HER 

12257
03:38:04,537 --> 03:38:06,506



12258
03:38:04,671 --> 03:38:08,241
ROLE IN REGARDS TO PRISON REFORM

12259
03:38:06,506 --> 03:38:08,241



12260
03:38:06,640 --> 03:38:10,243
AND IMMIGRATION.

12261
03:38:08,241 --> 03:38:10,243



12262
03:38:08,375 --> 03:38:12,044
I FEEL LIKE OTHER CANDIDATES 

12263
03:38:10,243 --> 03:38:12,044



12264
03:38:10,376 --> 03:38:13,980
SHOULD HAVE HELD HER FEET TO THE

12265
03:38:12,044 --> 03:38:13,980



12266
03:38:12,178 --> 03:38:15,281
FIRE AS THEY HELD JOE BIDEN TO 

12267
03:38:13,980 --> 03:38:15,281



12268
03:38:14,113 --> 03:38:16,082
THAT STANDARD AS WELL.

12269
03:38:15,281 --> 03:38:16,082



12270
03:38:15,415 --> 03:38:17,551
THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING TO 

12271
03:38:16,082 --> 03:38:17,551



12272
03:38:16,215 --> 03:38:18,184
SEE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN 

12273
03:38:17,551 --> 03:38:18,184



12274
03:38:17,684 --> 03:38:19,919
THE FUTURE.

12275
03:38:18,184 --> 03:38:19,919



12276
03:38:18,318 --> 03:38:22,422
HOWEVER, I DO FEEL THAT SHE WAS 

12277
03:38:19,919 --> 03:38:22,422



12278
03:38:20,053 --> 03:38:23,924
ABLE TO MAKE A VERY STRONG 

12279
03:38:22,422 --> 03:38:23,924



12280
03:38:22,555 --> 03:38:25,057
QUOTES THAT ARE GOING TO BE 

12281
03:38:23,924 --> 03:38:25,057



12282
03:38:24,057 --> 03:38:27,060
HEADLINERS AND FROM THAT, PEOPLE

12283
03:38:25,057 --> 03:38:27,060



12284
03:38:25,191 --> 03:38:27,994
ARE GOING TO BE UNDER THE 

12285
03:38:27,060 --> 03:38:27,994



12286
03:38:27,193 --> 03:38:29,662
IMPRESSION THAT SHE QUOTE 

12287
03:38:27,994 --> 03:38:29,662



12288
03:38:28,128 --> 03:38:31,164
UNQUOTE WON THE DEBATE.

12289
03:38:29,662 --> 03:38:31,164



12290
03:38:29,796 --> 03:38:32,432
I, HOWEVER DON'T THINK SO.

12291
03:38:31,164 --> 03:38:32,432



12292
03:38:31,298 --> 03:38:33,633
>> YOU DON'T THINK PEOPLE 

12293
03:38:32,432 --> 03:38:33,633



12294
03:38:32,565 --> 03:38:36,202
CHECKED HER ENOUGH.

12295
03:38:33,633 --> 03:38:36,202



12296
03:38:33,767 --> 03:38:36,969
BUT THE FACT THAT THAT DID NOT 

12297
03:38:36,202 --> 03:38:36,969



12298
03:38:36,335 --> 03:38:38,638
HAPPEN AND SHE WAS ABLE TO HOLD 

12299
03:38:36,969 --> 03:38:38,638



12300
03:38:37,103 --> 03:38:39,906
JOE BIDEN'S FEET TO THE FIRE AND

12301
03:38:38,638 --> 03:38:39,906



12302
03:38:38,772 --> 03:38:41,274
NOBODY CAME BACK AT HER, WHAT 

12303
03:38:39,906 --> 03:38:41,274



12304
03:38:40,040 --> 03:38:41,774
DOES THAT SAY ABOUT HER 

12305
03:38:41,274 --> 03:38:41,774



12306
03:38:41,408 --> 03:38:44,076
PERFORMANCE?

12307
03:38:41,774 --> 03:38:44,076



12308
03:38:41,908 --> 03:38:45,478
>> DEFINITELY VERY WORRYSOME, IN

12309
03:38:44,076 --> 03:38:45,478



12310
03:38:44,210 --> 03:38:47,647
THAT REGARD, AND ESPECIALLY, I'M

12311
03:38:45,478 --> 03:38:47,647



12312
03:38:45,612 --> 03:38:48,848
GOING TO KEEP GOING BACK TO HER 

12313
03:38:47,647 --> 03:38:48,848



12314
03:38:47,780 --> 03:38:50,517
STATEMENTS ABOUT PRISON REFORM.

12315
03:38:48,848 --> 03:38:50,517



12316
03:38:48,982 --> 03:38:51,450
SHE HAS A CONTROVERSIAL PAST 

12317
03:38:50,517 --> 03:38:51,450



12318
03:38:50,650 --> 03:38:54,054
ABOUT THAT AND THE FACT THAT 

12319
03:38:51,450 --> 03:38:54,054



12320
03:38:51,584 --> 03:38:55,889
NOBODY WAS ABLE TO BRING IT UP, 

12321
03:38:54,054 --> 03:38:55,889



12322
03:38:54,187 --> 03:38:58,491
AND SHE WAS ABLE TO KIND OF 

12323
03:38:55,889 --> 03:38:58,491



12324
03:38:56,022 --> 03:38:59,459
PAINT THE NARRATIVE OF 

12325
03:38:58,491 --> 03:38:59,459



12326
03:38:58,624 --> 03:39:01,528
INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN 

12327
03:38:59,459 --> 03:39:01,528



12328
03:38:59,592 --> 03:39:03,696
FIGHTING FOR THESE RIGHTS IS 

12329
03:39:01,528 --> 03:39:03,696



12330
03:39:01,661 --> 03:39:06,399
SOMEWHAT A PROBLEM TO ME.

12331
03:39:03,696 --> 03:39:06,399



12332
03:39:03,830 --> 03:39:08,067
>> DID SHE RESONATE WITH YOU

12333
03:39:06,399 --> 03:39:08,067



12334
03:39:06,532 --> 03:39:09,069
GUYS TONIGHT?

12335
03:39:08,067 --> 03:39:09,069



12336
03:39:08,201 --> 03:39:10,136
>> IT WAS IMPRESSIVE WHAT SHE 

12337
03:39:09,069 --> 03:39:10,136



12338
03:39:09,202 --> 03:39:11,371
HAD TO SAY.

12339
03:39:10,136 --> 03:39:11,371



12340
03:39:10,270 --> 03:39:13,940
AND THE CURRENT POSITIONS AND 

12341
03:39:11,371 --> 03:39:13,940



12342
03:39:11,504 --> 03:39:14,207
THINGS SHE SAID RESONATED WITH 

12343
03:39:13,940 --> 03:39:14,207



12344
03:39:14,074 --> 03:39:15,241
ME.

12345
03:39:14,207 --> 03:39:15,241



12346
03:39:14,341 --> 03:39:19,145
BUT I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE WHAT 

12347
03:39:15,241 --> 03:39:19,145



12348
03:39:15,375 --> 03:39:23,449
SHE BROUGHT ON OUT OF JOE BIDEN 

12349
03:39:19,145 --> 03:39:23,449



12350
03:39:19,278 --> 03:39:24,283
WAS LIKE -- WAS A LOT OF 

12351
03:39:23,449 --> 03:39:24,283



12352
03:39:23,583 --> 03:39:26,486
DISAPPOINTMENT THAT I FELT THAT 

12353
03:39:24,283 --> 03:39:26,486



12354
03:39:24,417 --> 03:39:26,853
HE DOUBLED DOWN ON THE PAST 

12355
03:39:26,486 --> 03:39:26,853



12356
03:39:26,619 --> 03:39:29,456
POSITION.

12357
03:39:26,853 --> 03:39:29,456



12358
03:39:26,986 --> 03:39:30,990
SHE WAS ABLE TO BRING OUT THE 

12359
03:39:29,456 --> 03:39:30,990



12360
03:39:29,589 --> 03:39:32,692
NASTY RACIAL TENSIONS THERE.

12361
03:39:30,990 --> 03:39:32,692



12362
03:39:31,124 --> 03:39:34,194
AND THE FACT THAT HE STILL IS 

12363
03:39:32,692 --> 03:39:34,194



12364
03:39:32,825 --> 03:39:35,228
KIND OF HOLDING SOME OF THOSE 

12365
03:39:34,194 --> 03:39:35,228



12366
03:39:34,327 --> 03:39:35,629
OLD VIEWS TODAY.

12367
03:39:35,228 --> 03:39:35,629



12368
03:39:35,362 --> 03:39:37,830
SO -- 

12369
03:39:35,629 --> 03:39:37,830



12370
03:39:35,762 --> 03:39:39,466
>> YEAH, I MEAN, YOU GUYS WHEN I

12371
03:39:37,830 --> 03:39:39,466



12372
03:39:37,964 --> 03:39:40,066
ASKED YOU ABOUT JOE BIDEN BEFORE

12373
03:39:39,466 --> 03:39:40,066



12374
03:39:39,599 --> 03:39:42,435
THE DEBATE.

12375
03:39:40,066 --> 03:39:42,435



12376
03:39:40,200 --> 03:39:44,670
I ASKED WHO WAS EXCITED, NOBODY 

12377
03:39:42,435 --> 03:39:44,670



12378
03:39:42,568 --> 03:39:47,006
RAISED THEIR HANDS.

12379
03:39:44,670 --> 03:39:47,006



12380
03:39:44,804 --> 03:39:48,641
WHAT DID HIS PERFORMANCE TONIGHT

12381
03:39:47,006 --> 03:39:48,641



12382
03:39:47,140 --> 03:39:48,908
DO TO CHANGE YOUR OPINION OF 

12383
03:39:48,641 --> 03:39:48,908



12384
03:39:48,775 --> 03:39:50,276
HIM?

12385
03:39:48,908 --> 03:39:50,276



12386
03:39:49,042 --> 03:39:52,379
>> HE IS HE WAS A DISTRACTION, I

12387
03:39:50,276 --> 03:39:52,379



12388
03:39:50,410 --> 03:39:54,380
FEEL LIKE THE ENTIRE DEBATE, 

12389
03:39:52,379 --> 03:39:54,380



12390
03:39:52,512 --> 03:39:56,215
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE CANDIDATES 

12391
03:39:54,380 --> 03:39:56,215



12392
03:39:54,514 --> 03:39:59,118
WERE USING THEIR TIME TO ATTACK 

12393
03:39:56,215 --> 03:39:59,118



12394
03:39:56,349 --> 03:40:00,487

12396
03:39:59,252 --> 03:40:01,420
THE TIME DEFENDING HIMSELF, 

12397
03:40:00,487 --> 03:40:01,420

12402
03:40:02,589 --> 03:40:04,990

12406
03:40:05,124 --> 03:40:06,892
THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF SUBSTANCE

12407
03:40:06,358 --> 03:40:06,892

THEY DID NOT GET AS MANY 

12421

12448
03:40:38,525 --> 03:40:41,294

12449
03:40:40,460 --> 03:40:41,294



12450
03:40:40,593 --> 03:40:44,030
DISAPPOINTING THING ABOUT THE

03:40:48,868 --> 03:40:49,469



12460
03:40:49,001 --> 03:40:51,404

03:40:49,469 --> 03:40:51,404



12462
03:40:49,603 --> 03:40:52,572
THAT IS NOT WHAT WE GOT TO SEE.

12464
03:40:51,538 --> 03:40:55,075

12465
03:40:52,572 --> 03:40:55,075

12600
03:42:59,832 --> 03:43:03,369

12608
03:43:06,873 --> 03:43:09,875
NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING OUT OF

12630
03:43:31,464 --> 03:43:34,667
THAT SHE WAS A STRONG SPEAKER.

12632
03:43:32,966 --> 03:43:35,401

12633
03:43:34,667 --> 03:43:35,401



12634
03:43:34,801 --> 03:43:36,603

03:43:35,535 --> 03:43:37,837
IN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

12637
03:43:36,603 --> 03:43:37,837



12638
03:43:36,736 --> 03:43:38,138
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY TAKE ON 

12639
03:43:37,837 --> 03:43:38,138



12640
03:43:37,971 --> 03:43:38,971
TRUMP.

12676
03:44:01,861 --> 03:44:10,503

12678
03:44:04,130 --> 03:44:10,870
NOT GET A DOSE OF HER OWN

12680
03:44:10,636 --> 03:44:12,939
MEDICINE.

12688
03:44:15,708 --> 03:44:20,779
IS THAT TRUE OR FALSE?

12689
03:44:18,744 --> 03:44:20,779



12690
03:44:18,878 --> 03:44:22,448
DID SHE WIN BECAUSE SHE DID NOT 

12691
03:44:20,779 --> 03:44:22,448



12692
03:44:20,913 --> 03:44:24,583
TAKE THE HEAT HERSELF?

03:44:22,448 --> 03:44:24,583



12694
03:44:22,582 --> 03:44:26,252

12696
03:44:24,717 --> 03:44:28,487
I THOUGHT SHE STOLE THE SHOW.

12697
03:44:26,252 --> 03:44:28,487



12698
03:44:26,386 --> 03:44:30,389
I THINK SHE CAME OFF ASSERTIVE.

12699
03:44:28,487 --> 03:44:30,389



12700
03:44:28,621 --> 03:44:34,293
CONFIDENT, SHE ANSWERED EVERY

DIRECT WAY.

12706
03:44:36,763 --> 03:44:39,966
I THINK THEY CAME OUT ON TOP.

12707
03:44:38,130 --> 03:44:39,966



12708
03:44:38,264 --> 03:44:42,001
I WALKED AWAY PERSONALLY HAVING 

12709
03:44:39,966 --> 03:44:42,001



12710
03:44:40,099 --> 03:44:42,335
A BETTER IDEA WHERE SHE STOOD ON

12711
03:44:42,001 --> 03:44:42,335



12712
03:44:42,135 --> 03:44:44,304

SCRUTINY FOR NOT BEING

12724
03:44:51,510 --> 03:44:55,782
SHE WAS ABLE TO EXPLOIT A FEW

12726
03:44:54,046 --> 03:44:57,116

03:44:57,249 --> 03:45:04,324
WHEN SHE CALLED OUT BIDEN ON THE

12736
03:45:06,659 --> 03:45:09,362
WAS ONE POLICY OF HER FORMER 

12737
03:45:08,328 --> 03:45:09,362



12738
03:45:08,461 --> 03:45:09,929

12742
03:45:10,063 --> 03:45:12,197
BUT, THAT WAS THE BENEFIT OF 

12743
03:45:11,430 --> 03:45:12,197



12744
03:45:11,564 --> 03:45:14,533

03:45:12,331 --> 03:45:15,802
I MEAN, SHE, WHEN HAD YOU ARE ON

12756
03:45:18,671 --> 03:45:25,711
AND IT WAS CLEAR, THAT THIS WAS 

12757
03:45:23,676 --> 03:45:25,711



12758
03:45:23,809 --> 03:45:26,980
SOMETHING, ATTACKING BIDEN ON

12760
03:45:25,844 --> 03:45:30,950
THE OPPOSITION, WAS SOMETHING 

12761
03:45:26,980 --> 03:45:30,950



12762
03:45:27,113 --> 03:45:31,684

12764
03:45:31,083 --> 03:45:32,651
WENT FOR IT AND DID NOT LET UP 

12765
03:45:31,684 --> 03:45:32,651



12766
03:45:31,817 --> 03:45:34,420

12768
03:45:32,785 --> 03:45:34,920
THAT WAS A DEFINING MOMENT OF

12770
03:45:34,553 --> 03:45:36,355
THE WEEK.

12771
03:45:34,920 --> 03:45:36,355



12772
03:45:35,054 --> 03:45:38,090
THAT WILL BE THE DEFINING MOMENT

12773
03:45:36,355 --> 03:45:38,090



12774
03:45:36,489 --> 03:45:39,458
OF THE ELECTION SO FAR. 

12775
03:45:38,090 --> 03:45:39,458



12776
03:45:38,224 --> 03:45:40,259

03:45:39,458 --> 03:45:40,259



12778
03:45:39,592 --> 03:45:42,161

12784
03:45:44,497 --> 03:45:48,167
WHY THE POLICE FORCE BACK IN

03:45:48,300 --> 03:45:50,570
SAID PLAINLY, I COULD NOT GET IT

12789
03:45:50,269 --> 03:45:50,570



12790
03:45:50,403 --> 03:45:52,471
DONE.

12791

12792
03:45:50,703 --> 03:45:53,772
WAS THAT REFRESHINGLY HONEST?

12793
03:45:52,471 --> 03:45:53,772



12794
03:45:52,605 --> 03:45:56,408
OR WAS THAT ENOUGH?

12795
03:45:53,772 --> 03:45:56,408



12796
03:45:53,906 --> 03:45:56,809
>> IT WAS HONEST, BUT IT WAS NOT

12797
03:45:56,408 --> 03:45:56,809



12798
03:45:56,542 --> 03:45:58,177
ENOUGH.

12799
03:45:56,809 --> 03:45:58,177



12800
03:45:56,943 --> 03:46:01,480
HE FELL SHORT.

12801
03:45:58,177 --> 03:46:01,480



12802
03:45:58,311 --> 03:46:02,749
I MEAN, YOU GAVE ME IN ALL OF 

12803
03:46:01,480 --> 03:46:02,749



12804
03:46:01,613 --> 03:46:03,282
THE REASONS WHY IT DID NOT GET 

12805

BUT YOU DID NOT GIVE ME, WHAT 

12809
03:46:04,817 --> 03:46:06,252



12810
03:46:04,951 --> 03:46:06,552
WILL YOU DO DIFFERENTLY?

12811
03:46:06,252 --> 03:46:06,552



12812
03:46:06,385 --> 03:46:08,154
RIGHT?

12813
03:46:06,552 --> 03:46:08,154



12814
03:46:06,686 --> 03:46:08,754
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BREAK 

12815
03:46:08,154 --> 03:46:08,754



12816
03:46:08,287 --> 03:46:12,624
THIS OPEN.

12817
03:46:08,754 --> 03:46:12,624



12818
03:46:08,888 --> 03:46:14,126
YOU CANNOT WALK IN TO THIS NEXT 

12819
03:46:12,624 --> 03:46:14,126



12820
03:46:12,758 --> 03:46:17,663
STAGE OF OUR PRESIDENCY, WITHOUT

12821
03:46:14,126 --> 03:46:17,663



12822
03:46:14,260 --> 03:46:21,200
BEING ABLE TO ANSWER THAT 

12823
03:46:17,663 --> 03:46:21,200

12825
03:46:21,200 --> 03:46:21,467



12826
03:46:21,334 --> 03:46:23,102
WAY.

12827
03:46:21,467 --> 03:46:23,102



12828
03:46:21,601 --> 03:46:23,536
WHAT IS YOUR PLAN TO DO IT 

12829
03:46:23,102 --> 03:46:23,536



12830
03:46:23,236 --> 03:46:24,537
DIFFERENTLY?

12831
03:46:23,536 --> 03:46:24,537



12832
03:46:23,669 --> 03:46:26,539
I DID NOT HEAR THAT AT ALL.

12833
03:46:24,537 --> 03:46:26,539



12834
03:46:24,670 --> 03:46:27,973
>> JACKIE, WHAT DID YOU THINK 

12835
03:46:26,539 --> 03:46:27,973



12836
03:46:26,672 --> 03:46:30,676
WHEN CONGRESSMAN SWALWELL LOOKED

12837
03:46:27,973 --> 03:46:30,676

12840
03:46:30,809 --> 03:46:32,578
POLICE CHIEF AND HE DID NOT SAY 

12841
03:46:32,211 --> 03:46:32,578



12842
03:46:32,345 --> 03:46:34,313
ANYTHING. 

12843
03:46:32,578 --> 03:46:34,313



12844
03:46:32,712 --> 03:46:35,548
>> RIGHT, AND I THINK THAT WAS 

12845
03:46:34,313 --> 03:46:35,548



12846
03:46:34,446 --> 03:46:37,983
INDICATIVE OF MAYOR PETE'S 

12847
03:46:35,548 --> 03:46:37,983



12848
03:46:35,681 --> 03:46:40,086
APPROACH TO POLITICS IN GENERAL.

12849
03:46:37,983 --> 03:46:40,086



12850
03:46:38,117 --> 03:46:42,055
LET'S SEE THE PROCESS PLAY OUT.

12851
03:46:40,086 --> 03:46:42,055



12852
03:46:40,219 --> 03:46:43,056
WE ARE CONDUCTING AN 

12853
03:46:42,055 --> 03:46:43,056



12854
03:46:42,188 --> 03:46:44,023
INVESTIGATION AND NOT COMING TO 

12855
03:46:43,056 --> 03:46:44,023



12856
03:46:43,189 --> 03:46:46,726
RASH DECISIONS.

12857
03:46:44,023 --> 03:46:46,726



12858
03:46:44,157 --> 03:46:47,727
BUT, I'M NOT NECESSARILY FOR THE

12859
03:46:46,726 --> 03:46:47,727



12860
03:46:46,859 --> 03:46:49,195
BEST OF ANSWERS THAT THE PUBLIC 

12861
03:46:47,727 --> 03:46:49,195



12862
03:46:47,860 --> 03:46:50,997
WANTS TO SEE RIGHT NOW, 

12863
03:46:49,195 --> 03:46:50,997



12864
03:46:49,328 --> 03:46:54,667
ESPECIALLY IN AFTER ERA OF THE 

12865
03:46:50,997 --> 03:46:54,667



12866
03:46:51,130 --> 03:46:56,235
POLITICS WHERE THINGS ARE 

12867
03:46:54,667 --> 03:46:56,235



12868
03:46:54,801 --> 03:46:57,936
PRETTY, ARE NOT RULES BASED.

12869
03:46:56,235 --> 03:46:57,936



12870
03:46:56,368 --> 03:47:00,739
AT LEAST IN TRUMP'S WORLD.

12871
03:46:57,936 --> 03:47:00,739



12872
03:46:58,070 --> 03:47:03,942
I THINK COMPARING HIM TO 

12873
03:47:00,739 --> 03:47:03,942



12874
03:47:00,873 --> 03:47:05,845
SOMEBODY LIKE CASTRO, WHO 

12875
03:47:03,942 --> 03:47:05,845



12876
03:47:04,076 --> 03:47:07,280
YESTERDAY, REALLY GOT AT HIS 

12877
03:47:05,845 --> 03:47:07,280

CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND HIS 

12879
03:47:07,280 --> 03:47:08,781



12880
03:47:07,413 --> 03:47:10,650
PLEASING REFORM AND WAS ABLE TO

TOUT ALL OF THE POLICIES, MAYOR 

12883
03:47:10,650 --> 03:47:13,186



12884
03:47:10,783 --> 03:47:15,755
PETE WAS NOT ABLE TO SHOW THE 

12885
03:47:13,186 --> 03:47:15,755



12886
03:47:13,319 --> 03:47:17,589
SAME, AND SO, TO ME, THE 

12887
03:47:15,755 --> 03:47:17,589



12888
03:47:15,888 --> 03:47:20,660
ACCOUNTABILITY IS A STEP 

12889
03:47:17,589 --> 03:47:20,660



12890
03:47:17,723 --> 03:47:20,960
FORWARDER AND A BIG CONTRAST TO 

12891
03:47:20,660 --> 03:47:20,960



12892
03:47:20,793 --> 03:47:25,264
BIDEN.

12893
03:47:20,960 --> 03:47:25,264



12894
03:47:21,094 --> 03:47:28,333
WHEN YOU -- WHEN YOU TEE HIM UP 

12895
03:47:25,264 --> 03:47:28,333



12896
03:47:25,397 --> 03:47:29,034
NEXT TO CASTRO, YOU KNOW, THAT 

12897
03:47:28,333 --> 03:47:29,034



12898
03:47:28,467 --> 03:47:31,604
WAS SOMETHING WHEN THEY ARE 

12899
03:47:29,034 --> 03:47:31,604



12900
03:47:29,168 --> 03:47:32,304
SITTING NEXT TO EACH OTHER, IT 

12901
03:47:31,604 --> 03:47:32,304



12902
03:47:31,737 --> 03:47:34,540
WILL SHOW. 

12903
03:47:32,304 --> 03:47:34,540



12904
03:47:32,438 --> 03:47:36,809
>> ONE THING WE HAD SPECKS ON.

12905
03:47:34,540 --> 03:47:36,809



12906
03:47:34,674 --> 03:47:38,544
HE HAD VERY STRONG WORDS.

12907
03:47:36,809 --> 03:47:38,544



12908
03:47:36,943 --> 03:47:40,479
HE SAID, CHINA IS USING 

12909
03:47:38,544 --> 03:47:40,479



12910
03:47:38,677 --> 03:47:42,515
TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PERFECTION OF

12911
03:47:40,479 --> 03:47:42,515



12912
03:47:40,612 --> 03:47:45,118
DICTATOR SHIP.

12913
03:47:42,515 --> 03:47:45,118



12914
03:47:42,648 --> 03:47:47,553
DID HE REALLY LAYOUT A 

12915
03:47:45,118 --> 03:47:47,553



12916
03:47:45,251 --> 03:47:48,554
DEMOCRATIC ALTERNATIVE TO 

12917
03:47:47,553 --> 03:47:48,554



12918
03:47:47,686 --> 03:47:50,789
DEALING WITH CHINA?

12919
03:47:48,554 --> 03:47:50,789



12920
03:47:48,687 --> 03:47:53,025
>> NO, NOT REALLY.

12921
03:47:50,789 --> 03:47:53,025



12922
03:47:50,923 --> 03:47:55,995
YOU HEARD OTHERS MENTIONING THE 

12923
03:47:53,025 --> 03:47:55,995



12924
03:47:53,158 --> 03:47:57,529
PUSH BACK AGAINST CHINA TO 

12925
03:47:55,995 --> 03:47:57,529



12926
03:47:56,128 --> 03:48:01,033
CONFRONT THEIR BEHAVIOR.

12927
03:47:57,529 --> 03:48:01,033



12928
03:47:57,663 --> 03:48:06,472
CERTAINLY YOU HEARD THE MENTION 

12929
03:48:01,033 --> 03:48:06,472



12930
03:48:01,166 --> 03:48:08,140
OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THE 

12931
03:48:06,472 --> 03:48:08,140



12932
03:48:06,605 --> 03:48:08,607
ISSUE THAT THEY CAN RALLY 

12933
03:48:08,140 --> 03:48:08,607



12934
03:48:08,274 --> 03:48:10,777
AROUND.

12935
03:48:08,607 --> 03:48:10,777



12936
03:48:08,741 --> 03:48:12,945
I DID NOT HEAR MUCH SPECIFICS 

12937
03:48:10,777 --> 03:48:12,945



12938
03:48:10,910 --> 03:48:15,748
WITH ANY FOREIGN POLICY.

12939
03:48:12,945 --> 03:48:15,748



12940
03:48:13,079 --> 03:48:19,318
>> WHAT ABOUT WHEN HE TALKED 

12941
03:48:15,748 --> 03:48:19,318



12942
03:48:15,881 --> 03:48:19,719
ABOUT THE PATHWAY TO 

12943
03:48:19,318 --> 03:48:19,719



12944
03:48:19,452 --> 03:48:20,753
CITIZENSHIP.

12945
03:48:19,719 --> 03:48:20,753



12946
03:48:19,852 --> 03:48:24,423
HE SAID THERE'S 11 MILLION 

12947
03:48:20,753 --> 03:48:24,423



12948
03:48:20,887 --> 03:48:26,525
PEOPLE, BUT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS 

12949
03:48:24,423 --> 03:48:26,525



12950
03:48:24,556 --> 03:48:26,826
DIVIDED US ON THE COMMON GROUND 

12951
03:48:26,525 --> 03:48:26,826



12952
03:48:26,659 --> 03:48:28,060
ISSUE.

12953
03:48:26,826 --> 03:48:28,060



12954
03:48:26,959 --> 03:48:29,962
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12955
03:48:28,060 --> 03:48:29,962



12956
03:48:28,194 --> 03:48:31,396
>> IT'S A COMMON GROUND ISSUE, 

12957
03:48:29,962 --> 03:48:31,396



12958
03:48:30,095 --> 03:48:33,298
WITH A KMOND BIG END GOAL.

12959
03:48:31,396 --> 03:48:33,298



12960
03:48:31,530 --> 03:48:34,367
WE DISAGREE IN THE DETAILS.

12961
03:48:33,298 --> 03:48:34,367



12962
03:48:33,432 --> 03:48:35,367
WE HAVE BEEN DIVIDED ON THE 

12963
03:48:34,367 --> 03:48:35,367



12964
03:48:34,500 --> 03:48:37,136
ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME.

12965
03:48:35,367 --> 03:48:37,136



12966
03:48:35,501 --> 03:48:40,173
SO, I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS 

12967
03:48:37,136 --> 03:48:40,173



12968
03:48:37,270 --> 03:48:41,707
THAT CAME UP, WAS THE OBAMA 

12969
03:48:40,173 --> 03:48:41,707



12970
03:48:40,306 --> 03:48:42,274
RECORD, THEY CALL IT THE 

12971
03:48:41,707 --> 03:48:42,274



12972
03:48:41,841 --> 03:48:44,509
DEPORTATION CHIEF.

12973
03:48:42,274 --> 03:48:44,509



12974
03:48:42,408 --> 03:48:46,378
THE DEPORTER IN CHIEF.

12975
03:48:44,509 --> 03:48:46,378



12976
03:48:44,643 --> 03:48:46,779
WAS NOT FAMILY SEPARATION, IT'S 

12977
03:48:46,378 --> 03:48:46,779



12978
03:48:46,512 --> 03:48:49,114
DEPORTATION.

12979
03:48:46,779 --> 03:48:49,114



12980
03:48:46,912 --> 03:48:53,986
IT'S A DIFFERENCE THERE AND WHAT

12981
03:48:49,114 --> 03:48:53,986



12982
03:48:49,248 --> 03:48:57,423
IS NOW, IS VIOLENTLY AGGRESSIVE 

12983
03:48:53,986 --> 03:48:57,423



12984

13380
03:58:13,779 --> 03:58:17,148
THAT IS NOT A WIDE MARGIN THAT 

13381
03:58:15,647 --> 03:58:17,148



13382
03:58:15,781 --> 03:58:18,617
IS NOT BEATABLE.

13383
03:58:17,148 --> 03:58:18,617



13384
03:58:17,282 --> 03:58:20,485
IF I'M GOING TO MAKE THE CASE 

13385
03:58:18,617 --> 03:58:20,485



13386
03:58:18,750 --> 03:58:21,920

13387
03:58:20,485 --> 03:58:21,920



13388
03:58:20,619 --> 03:58:22,987
I MAKE UP THE MARGINS?

13389
03:58:21,920 --> 03:58:22,987



13390
03:58:22,054 --> 03:58:26,024
THAT HAS TO BE THE QUESTION WHEN

13391
03:58:22,987 --> 03:58:26,024



13392
03:58:23,121 --> 03:58:26,391
WHEN YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT 

13393
03:58:26,024 --> 03:58:26,391



13394
03:58:26,158 --> 03:58:27,993
POLITICS.

13395
03:58:26,391 --> 03:58:27,993



13396
03:58:26,525 --> 03:58:29,427

13397
03:58:27,993 --> 03:58:29,427



13398
03:58:28,126 --> 03:58:30,562
FOCUSING ON DONALD TRUM.

13399
03:58:29,427 --> 03:58:30,562



13400
03:58:29,561 --> 03:58:30,863
IT WAS ABOUT FOCUSING ON EACH 

13401
03:58:30,562 --> 03:58:30,863



13402
03:58:30,696 --> 03:58:33,665

03:58:38,137 --> 03:58:41,106



13412
03:58:38,270 --> 03:58:43,041
STAGE, THEY WERE COMING FOR THE 

13413
03:58:41,106 --> 03:58:43,041



13414
03:58:41,239 --> 03:58:47,713

13415
03:58:43,041 --> 03:58:47,713

BERNIE.

13421
03:58:52,584 --> 03:58:55,153



13422
03:58:52,718 --> 03:58:57,789
DID THAT WORK?

13423
03:58:55,153 --> 03:58:57,789



13424
03:58:55,287 --> 03:59:00,425
>> I THINK IT IS HARD TO KEEP 

13425
03:58:57,789 --> 03:59:00,425

03:59:00,859 --> 03:59:03,562
TO STAND OUT, YOU HAVE TO GO 

13431
03:59:02,828 --> 03:59:03,562



13432
03:59:02,961 --> 03:59:04,829

03:59:28,219 --> 03:59:31,122
VICE PRESIDENT.

13476
03:59:32,591 --> 03:59:36,361
STOOD OUT AS MUCH AS SECRETARY 

13477
03:59:34,493 --> 03:59:36,361

13483
03:59:44,203 --> 03:59:47,605



13484
03:59:44,336 --> 03:59:49,441

03:59:49,575 --> 03:59:52,010
CANDIDATES.

13489

DID NOT DO ANYTHING TO HELP 

13499
04:00:00,486 --> 04:00:01,853

04:00:04,323 --> 04:00:05,924
CURIOUS.

13507
04:00:04,523 --> 04:00:05,924



13508
04:00:04,656 --> 04:00:07,559
WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU

HEARD TONIGHT THAT WOULD REALLY 

13511

04:00:10,695 --> 04:00:13,131



13516
04:00:10,829 --> 04:00:14,399

13520
04:00:14,533 --> 04:00:17,135
RIGHT?

13521
04:00:14,700 --> 04:00:17,135



13522
04:00:14,833 --> 04:00:18,370
THERE'S SO MANY DEBATES TO COME.

13523
04:00:17,135 --> 04:00:18,370



13524
04:00:17,269 --> 04:00:19,838
CANDIDATES HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

13530
04:00:20,439 --> 04:00:22,807
WE DO NOT PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION

13531
04:00:22,006 --> 04:00:22,807



13532
04:00:22,140 --> 04:00:24,376

13534
04:00:22,941 --> 04:00:25,477
DEBATE PERFORMANCES ARE GREAT, 

13535
04:00:24,376 --> 04:00:25,477



13536
04:00:24,509 --> 04:00:27,245
BUT ARE YOU LAYING THE

04:00:25,477 --> 04:00:27,245



13538
04:00:25,611 --> 04:00:29,548

13546
04:00:31,483 --> 04:00:34,118
AND IT'S TOO EARLY TO PREDICT 

13547
04:00:33,418 --> 04:00:34,118



13548
04:00:33,552 --> 04:00:35,520

QUESTION IS, BY TAKING THAT
